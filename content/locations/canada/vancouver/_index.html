<p>I really can't believe that Vancouver is one of Canada's warmer cities, and that I'm visiting it at a warmer time of year, and that it's still the coldest city I've ever been in. I hate to imagine how cold the rest of Canada is! However, cold aside, Vancouver is an absolutely gorgeous place, with a combination of harbour, islands, bridges, and mountains that simply dazzle the eye. Pity that I couldn't have stayed here longer on this trip, because I certainly could imagine being able to get quite comfortable here.
