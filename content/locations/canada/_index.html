<p>Beautiful and relaxed country, if a little cold. Canada is probably about the least exotic place that an Australian can go, because it's so similar to Australia in so many ways. It's full of Australians. It's laid-back. It's safe. It's (mainly) English-speaking. It's a close ally of the USA, and yet its people despise Yanks in general. I didn't get much time to explore the land of the maple-leaf on this trip, but I hope to return and see it properly some other time.
