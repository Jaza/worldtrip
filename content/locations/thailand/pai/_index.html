<p>Pai can best be described as "the Byron Bay of Thailand". Much like that beautiful and famous town on Australia's east coast, Pai is the biggest hippie retreat in Thailand, and hence is one of the most chilled-out places in the whole country. Situated north-west of Chiang Mai &mdash; deep in the mountainous jungle of Thailand's north &mdash; Pai is well-known for its music scene, for its motor-bike riding, and for the river-rafting and trekking opportunities that the surrounding forests offer. Fortunately, Pai hasn't yet been completely overrun by high-end resorts and by rich yuppies &mdash; it's 5 or 10 years behind Byron in that regard &mdash; but it's certainly on its way. As with all visitors to the town, I stayed in Pai longer than intended &mdash; and I didn't regret it one little bit.</p>
