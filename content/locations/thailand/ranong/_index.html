<p>Ranong is a small town, and is the capital of one of Thailand's most rural and sparsely-populated provinces. Ranong is located on the upper west coast of Thailand's narrow southern half, and it looks over the watery divide that marks the Thai-Burmese border. Like most tourists, Ranong wasn't a destination as such for me: I just popped in here this morning, in order to make a "visa run" over the water to Myanmar (formerly Burma), in order to reset my 30-day visa-free period in Thailand.</p>
