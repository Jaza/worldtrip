<p>At 2,565m <abbr title="above sea level">asl</abbr>, Doi Inthanon is Thailand's highest mountain. Doi Inthanon is situated in a remote, jungle-covered region of the country's north &mdash; just south-west of Chiang Mai &mdash; and the largely pristine jungle for a broad radius around the mountain is a protected National Park. Today I began a three-day trek in the National Park area: I didn't actually ascend the mountain itself, but I did explore the area near to it, which includes some gorgeous rivers and waterfalls, and some remote hill-tribe villages.</p>
