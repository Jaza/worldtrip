<p>Bangkok is Thailand's steaming-hot capital, and it's one of the largest and the most sophisticated metropolises in all of Asia. Bangkok boasts a modern urban train system, a world-class airport, a selection of accommodation from grungy to ritzy, and a plethora of services dedicated to the needs of its many Western tourists. And all this, despite it being in many ways the third-world centre of a third-world country. Bangkok was my first stop in Thailand &mdash; as well as the first place I've ever visited in Asia (airports aside) &mdash; and like thousands of backpackers before me (and no doubt thousands more after me), I was thrown head-first into the "experience" that is the backpacker mecca of Khao San Road.</p>
