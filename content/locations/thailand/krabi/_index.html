<p>Krabi is a pleasant little town, which is the capital of Krabi province in southern Thailand, and which is an important access point to numerous popular tourist attractions in the surrounding region. Krabi is the gateway to such gems as Ko Phi-Phi, Ko Lanta, and Railay beach. I spent a night here in town, before moving on to explore its nearby sights and sounds.</p>
