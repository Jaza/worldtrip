<p>Chiang Mai is the main city of northern Thailand, and is one of the key cultural and arts centres of the country. Chiang Mai is considered the most important city in Thailand after Bangkok &mdash; but unlike the megalopolis further south, Chiang Mai is pleasantly cool, reasonably low in air pollution, and easy-going and friendly. The city is also the jumping-off point for the many adventure activities available in northern Thailand, including jungle trekking, river rafting, and rock-climbing.</p>
