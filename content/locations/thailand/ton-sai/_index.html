<p>Ton Sai is a friendly, haphazard, cheap little hippie backpacker oasis, set amidst a desert of over-developed resort strips. Ton Sai is located on Railay Peninsula &mdash; the famous home of Thailand's best rock-climbing walls, and also of some of the country's most gorgeous beaches &mdash; and it's squeezed in between the beaches of Ao Nang and Railay West. It's only accessible by boat (or by several rugged walking tracks, some traversable only at low tide), and there are no paved roads (and few unpaved ones, either). I spent almost a week here in Ton Sai &mdash; if I had more time, I definitely would have done "the Ton Sai thing", and got stuck here for much longer than planned.</p>
