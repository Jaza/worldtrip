<p>Ko Tao is the smallest of the three famous islands in Surat Thani province, on the gulf coast of southern Thailand &mdash; its two larger and more-developed neighbours are Ko Pha-Ngan, and the mega-attraction Ko Samui. Like its neighbours, Ko Tao is a tropical paradise, and is every holiday-maker's dream. Over the past decade or so, the island has evolved into Thailand's premier spot for scuba diving, with about 50 dive schools operating on the island. I'm here to do the famous PADI beginner diver's certification; and after that, I'll stay here as long as I can, because I can imagine fewer places more blissful on all this Earth.</p>
