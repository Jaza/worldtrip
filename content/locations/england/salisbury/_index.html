<p>Salisbury is a small and ancient town, nestled in the countryside of England's south. Apart from having the tallest cathedral in the country, Salisbury's other big claim to fame is that it's the nearest major town to Stonehenge, the world-renowned millenia-old and mysterious circle of stones, that are on the empty high plains just a few miles away. I didn't actually visit Salisbury itself (although I would have liked to): however, I did get to see Stonehenge.</p>
