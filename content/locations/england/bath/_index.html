<p>One of the most ancient towns in all of England, Bath is so named because of the naturally hot thermal springs that sprout forth in its central block, and that have been used for bathing and relaxation since Roman times. Bath is a very posh and expensive little tourist town, and it's a common weekend getaway spot for Londoners. I'm staying in Bath for a few days, and making it my base for exploring nearby places such as Bristol and Salisbury.</p>
