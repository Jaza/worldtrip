<p>The only thing I can really say about London, is that I can't believe I've never been here before. Seems ridiculous, really. London is the centre of Great Britain, and the centre of an awful lot of other things &mdash; once upon a time, it was even technically the political centre of <em>Australia</em>. Anyway: apart from crazy prices, god-awful weather, and an insanely neverending mass of people, it seems like a great place. If anyone has a message for Her Majesty... well, then I'm sure she has a Hotmail account or something, so you can send it to her yourself.</p>
