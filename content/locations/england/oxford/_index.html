<p>Home of hunchbacked professors, moss-entombed ivory towers, and centuries-old prestige, Oxford is a charming and historic town in Central England, and home to one of the oldest and most famous universities in the world. Studying in Oxford is the dream of every aspiring academic: perhaps I'll be lucky enough to study there one day; but for now, I've settled on a tourist's day trip to the place. Certainly better than not seeing it at all.</p>
