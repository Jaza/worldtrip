<p>As a born-and-bred Aussie, it is my sacred duty to (at the least) stop by in the Mother Country, as part of any respectable backpacking trip. Rather. So I've come to England: home of tea, fish and chips, big red buses, pints, and of course Silly Walks. Should be a simply splendid little stopover.</p>
