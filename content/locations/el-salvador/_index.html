<p>The tiny Central American nation of El Salvador is a steamy, tropical, and highly impoverished banana republic. I didn't really stop in El Salvador &mdash; I just passed through here, and changed flights on my way from Brazil to the USA. But it looks like a beautiful little place, and one that I'd like to check out properly one day.</p>
