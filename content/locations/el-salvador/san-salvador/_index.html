<p>San Salvador is the capital city, and the only really sizeable city, in the tiny Central American nation of El Salvador. I didn't go into the city, or explore the country at all, on this trip &mdash; I just passed through San Salvador airport, and changed flights, on my way from Brazil to the USA.</p>
