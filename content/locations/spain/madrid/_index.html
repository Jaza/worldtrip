<p>Spain's capital and largest city, Madrid is a big yet undaunting place that's located smack-bang in the centre of the country. Madrid was my first stop in <em>España bonita</em>, and in my opinion it provides a great first impression of the country: energetic yet laid-back; historic yet modern; and friendly and easy to acquaint yourself with. Madrid has plenty to offer for those seeking the arts, film and history, as well as even more for the avid party-goer. I came here to celebrate the dawn of 2008, the Latin <em>madrileño</em> way.</p>
