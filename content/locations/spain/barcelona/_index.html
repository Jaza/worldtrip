<p>Capital of Catalonia (the Catal√°n speaking part of Spain), Barcelona is &mdash; simply put &mdash; one of the world's great cities. It was home to the 1992 Olympic Games. It's one of the key cultural, transport and economic centres of Europe. And it's infamous for being one of the craziest party hotspots in the world &mdash; even by crazy Spanish partying standards. Barcelona's fondness for doing everything late, likewise, is also virtually unrivalled even in Spain. With all this to its name, how could I possibly miss visiting a city like this?</p>
