<p>Home of tapas, conquistadores, and plains with rains, Spain (<em>en Español:</em> "España") is a big country with a lot of contrasting regions. Since it's where most of Latin America's pioneers and conquerers came from, it's also a fascinating look into the origin of so many cultural and social nuances to be found across the Atlantic. Particularly so for me, since I've enjoyed so much of this year in the Latin world. I spent one week here in Spain, to celebrate the start of 2008 in a place where they party like no-one else knows how.</p>
