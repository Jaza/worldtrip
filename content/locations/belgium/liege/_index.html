<p>Liège is one of the chief cities in the French-speaking southern part of Belgium known as Walloon. It doesn't have an awful lot of fame to its name &mdash; and as such, it's not on every tourist's must-visit list &mdash; but it boasts a gorgeous historic centre, and a proud and unique local cultural vibe. I came to Liège mainly to visit my friend Christian and his family, whom I stayed with tonight.</p>
