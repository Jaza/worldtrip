<p>Squashed between France, The Netherlands, and Germany (and also next to miniscule Luxembourg), Belgium is one of Europe's smaller countries &mdash; but its small size and small reputation bely what it has to offer. Belgium is the perfect example of European multi-lingual craziness: the country is roughly 60% Flemish-speaking (i.e. Dutch-speaking), and 40% French-speaking; but there are also some German-speaking spots, <em>plus</em> almost everyone speaks English at least semi-fluently. Not to be missed are Belgium's amazing chocolates, its hot crunchy waffles, and its formidable array of 500+ locally-brewed beers.</p>
