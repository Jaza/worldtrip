<p>Brussels is the cosmopolitan political capital of <em>petite</em> Belgium. Straddling the border of the Dutch-speaking north and the French-speaking south, it's predominantly a French city &mdash; although on the street, you'll hear every language under the sun being spoken. As well as being the capital of Belgium, Brussels is also the administrative home of the European Union (the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Parliament can be found here), of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr>, and of numerous multinational corporations. I passed through Brussels and spent several hours exploring it today, on my way up to Amsterdam.</p>
