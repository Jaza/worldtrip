<p>Antwerp is the principal city of Flanders &mdash; i.e. Dutch-speaking northern Belgium &mdash; and today, its rich historical roots and its lively bar scene attract many a tourist or two. I didn't stay any nights in Antwerp; but I spent most of the day here today, on a trip from Turnhout with my friends Annick and Stef.</p>
