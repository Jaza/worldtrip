<p>Turnhout is not exactly one of the tourist hotspots of Europe &mdash; nevertheless, this small town was my first stop in the tiny nation of Belgium. Situated about 50km's east of Antwerp &mdash; in the northern reaches of Belgium, near the Dutch border &mdash; Turnhout is a quaint but mediocre place to hang out. I came here to visit my friends Annick and Stef, with whom I stayed for two nights, and with whom I had an absolute blast.</p>
