<p>Located in the rolling and ancient countryside south-west of Palermo, Segesta is a set of Greek ruins that harks back to the empires that ruled Sicily millenia ago. The ruins at Segesta include a beautiful temple, as well as an expansive ampitheatre. I visited the ruins today, and I camped in a field nearby during the night.</p>
