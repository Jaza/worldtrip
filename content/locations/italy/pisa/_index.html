<p>Pisa is world-famous for one thing, and for one thing only: it's leaning tower! However, considering its big attraction and its tourist draw, Pisa is a surprisingly relaxed and pleasant city. As well as having a gorgeous (and architecturally brilliant) main <em>piazza</em>, Pisa is also home to a large university, and to thousands of regular Italians. Since it's only an hour's train ride west from Firenze (Florence), many tourists only visit Pisa as a day trip &mdash; but I decided to soak the place up properly, and to stay two nights.</p>
