<p>Situated between the cities of Palermo and Messina, on Sicily's north coast, Cefalù is a gorgeous and historic seaside town, and it's one of the most popular tourist destinations in Sicily. Fortunately, despite being overrun in the summer, Cefalù is nice and quiet in November. I spent a night in the town, before continuing on towards Palermo.</p>
