<p>Located in the north-west area of Italy's southernmost territory, Palermo is the capital of Sicily, and a sprawling and chaotic city. Famed with having many historic landmarks, a crazy but good-spirited populace, and an enduring mafia influence, you can't visit Sicily without at least passing through the place. I stayed in Palermo for one night, before continuing on my great Sicilian bike ride.</p>
