<p>The very name brings with it allusions that almost everyone in the world should recognise (that is, anyone who's seen or who's read <em>The Godfather</em>). Situated in the highlands south of Palermo, Corleone is the heart of the traditional Sicilian mafia territory. Today, there's no evidence of the mafia still being here &mdash; and indeed, the locals will tell you that they haven't been here for years. So they claim: I have the bullet wounds to prove otherwise :P.</p>
