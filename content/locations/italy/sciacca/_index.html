<p>Nestled in the south-west coastal corner of Sicily, Sciacca is a charming old town, famous for its artistic works of ceramics, and with breathtaking views of the Mediterranean from its refined plazas. I passed through Sciacca on my trip this afternoon, and camped in a field just past it during the night.</p>
