<p>Santo Stéfano is a gorgeous seaside town, on the north coast of Sicily, that's famous for its ornate local ceramics. It's on a small peninsula, and it's in a fairly quiet area, considering how over-developed other parts of this coast are. I spent one night in the town, before going up into the Nebrodi highlands on my bicycle.</p>
