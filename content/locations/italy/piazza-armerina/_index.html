<p>Piazza Armerina is a small town located in the mountains, just inland from the gorgeous southern coast of Sicily. It's famous for its nearby ruins of Villa Romana del Casale, a Roman palace whose floors are filled with some of Europe's most gorgeous mosaics. I visited the villa this afternoon, and this evening I camped at a site near the town.</p>
