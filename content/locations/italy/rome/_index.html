<p>If London's the home of the 'ol bird, then I guess Rome would be the home of the 'ol geyser. Home of waaay too many things to list, really &mdash; although I will give it a shot: the Colisseum, St. Peter's, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python's_Life_of_Brian">the aqueduct</a>, if I must name a few. Just in Rome for a few days, before I head south for some even better pizza.</p>
