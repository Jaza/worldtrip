<p>Giardini Naxos is a beach resort town on Sicily's sun-drenched east coast, between the cities of Catania and Messina. Its neighbouring town of Taormina is more famous &mdash; a hilltop town, Taormina is one of the trendiest and most charming tourist destinations in Sicily &mdash; however, Giardini is a bit more laid-back, and the prices here are much more reasonable. I spent one night here, before continuing north to Messina.</p>
