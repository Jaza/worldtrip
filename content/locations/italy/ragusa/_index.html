<p>Ragusa is one of several hilltop towns in the low mountains of Sicily's south-east, which is famous for its incredible baroque architecture. Modern Ragusa has expanded since its baroque days, and an urban expanse of it now sprawls out to the west; but the historic centre on the eastern edge of the town is still charming. Last night I camped north of Ragusa, and this morning I passed through the town.</p>
