<p>Once the capital of the ancient Greek establishment here in Sicily (which was significant, in its day), Syracuse (<em>Siracusa</em> in Italian) is now the heart of modern Sicily's gorgeous south-east. The historic centre of the city, the island of Ortygia, is where most of the tourists hang out. I spent one night in the city, while getting some repairs done on my bicycle.</p>
