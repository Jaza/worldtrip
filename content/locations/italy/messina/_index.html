<p>Just a stone's throw across the water from the Italian mainland, Messina is a bustling port town that's the gateway to the island of Sicily. Messina was the first stop on my great Sicilian ride,  since I caught the train down to Villa San Giovanni (from Rome), which is directly across the channel from the town. Nice town, but not much to see here.</p>
