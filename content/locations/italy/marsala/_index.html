<p>Marsala is the centre of Sicily's prime wine-growing area, located on the south-west coast of the island. Also of interest near Marsala is the island of Mozia, located beside a lovely coastal road just to the north. I went through Marsala this afternoon, and camped in a field not far from it.</p>
