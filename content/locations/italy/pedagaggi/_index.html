<p>Pedagaggi is a teeny village &mdash; in the northern foothills of Sicily's Monti Iblei &mdash; which overlooks the plain of Catania, and Mount Etna beyond. I camped it rough in a spot about &frac12; an hour north of Pedagaggi this evening, and I rode through the village the following morning.</p>
