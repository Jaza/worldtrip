<p>Like the nearby town of Ragusa, Modica is another hilltop town in the mountains of south-east Sicily, that's famous for its baroque architecture. Although Modica is very close to Ragusa, today I was held up by bad weather, and I was able to go no further than Modica &mdash; so I spent the night here.</p>
