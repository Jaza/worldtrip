<p>The main city on Sicily's south coast, Agrigento is most famous for the "Valle dei Templi", the magnificent and expansive Greek ruins that lie just south of the city, in a valley between the city and the sea. I spent this afternoon exploring the ruins, and I spent a night in the town as well.</p>
