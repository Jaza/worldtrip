<p>Tindari is a teeny village atop a mountainous little peninsula (Capo Tindari), on the north coast of Sicily. The place is famous for its Greek and Roman ruins (called by their original name of Tyndaris), and for its large and much-visited hilltop church. I spent the night camping just down the hill from Tindari, and then I rode up to visit the place the next morning.</p>
