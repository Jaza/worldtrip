<p>Its full name is <em>San Carlos de Bariloche</em>. It's one of Argentina's biggest tourist destinations, and it's my first stop in this great and expansive country. The town itself is chock-full of tourist accommodation, cheap and dear alike, as well as countless bars and discos. Nearby is beautiful Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi. And the biggest attraction of all (for me, at least!): just 20 minutes away, is Cerro Catedral &mdash; one of the largest alpine ski resorts in South America. I'm here for a week, and enjoying every minute of it.</p>
