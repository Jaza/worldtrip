<p>Located on the Argentinean side of the infamous South American "tri-border" (shared by Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay), Puerto Iguazú is the place to go and to marvel at Argentina's view of the colossal Iguazu Falls, the second-biggest set of waterfalls on the planet. The town itself is quite small and cosy (considering the nearby attractions, and the town's use as a transport hub), and is a good place to stop and relax for a bit, before continuing further to wherever it is you're going (Brazil, in my case).</p>
