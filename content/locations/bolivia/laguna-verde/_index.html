<p>A big, clear lagoon at very high altitude, in the extreme south-west corner of Bolivia. The lagoon gets its name from the striking green colours that it exhibits, when its waters and its various mineral deposits get mixed up by high winds. I visited the Laguna Verde as part of my three-day Salar de Uyuni tour.</p>
