<p>Potosí is part of the historic, colonial south-west of Bolivia; and it's a prime stop on the Bolivian <em>gringo</em> trail, due to its famous 400-year-old mines in the nearby mountain of Cerro Rico. Potosí also claims to be the world's highest city. It's a nice place, and for most of the day and evening, it's quite lively and has a good atmosphere. Quite cold, though.</p>
