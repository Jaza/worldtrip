<p>The Salar de Uyuni is the world's largest and highest salt falt, and it lies in the south-west corner of the Bolivian <em>altiplano</em> ("high plains"). The salt flat itself is a spectacle to behold, as are the numerous lagoons, geysers, ice-capped mountains, and hot springs in the area. I went to the Salar de Uyuni on a tour from the town of Uyuni in Bolivia, before continuing on to the Chilean frontier.
