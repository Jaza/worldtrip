<p>Beautiful island in Lake Titicaca, and the principal island on the Bolivian side of the lake. Isla Del Sol is a sacred island for the people of both Peru and Bolivia; as according to Inca mythology, it is the birthplace of the sun. I spent one night on this island, in a guesthouse, and I did the 3-hour walk from the southern to the northern end of the island.
