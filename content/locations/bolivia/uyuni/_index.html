<p>A remote and sleepy town on Bolivia's south-western frontier, Uyuni is a cold and tourist-filled town, and the gateway to the nearby Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest and highest salt flat. Really no reason to stay here for long, except to book a tour to the salt flats, and perhaps to grab a pizza or two. There's also a train line that goes through Uyuni, from Oruro further north, down to Villazon in the South; with an additional line heading west into Chile, from Potos√≠ in the east.</p>
