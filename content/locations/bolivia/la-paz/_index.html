<p>La Paz is the de facto capital of Bolivia, it's a city of 1.5 million; and at 3,600m <abbr title="Above Sea Level">a.s.l</abbr>, it's really, really high. La Paz has a number of attractions, such as the nearby ruins of Tiwanaku, the famous "death road" bike ride, and the world's strangest jail, San Pedro. Also has beautiful, snow-capped mountains surrounding it on all sides.</p>
