<p>Copacabana may be on the edge of a large body of water (like the well-known beach of the same name, in Brazil); but it's a lot higher up and a lot colder than any tropical resort. However, I can see why it was named so; because despite its lack of tropical heat, Copacabana is a beautiful, laid-back, resort-ish little town, hugging the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca. It's also the gateway to the lovely Isla Del Sol.
