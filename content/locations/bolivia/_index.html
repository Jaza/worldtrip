<p>Often considered one of South America's more corrupt, poverty-stricken, and chaotic countries, Bolivia is also a country full of fun, adventure, and diversity. If you can handle the fact that nothing ever works, that no price is ever fixed, and that even the most basic everyday systems are not as you expect (or simply <em>are not</em>), then Bolivia is definitely worth the effort. Also (on the <em>altiplano</em>, at least) home of the world's highest everything.</p>
