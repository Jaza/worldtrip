<p>Bolivia's official capital (although La Paz is de facto, and is vying to steal the official status), Sucre is a beautiful, historic, colonial city in the south-west of the country. When you go to Sucre, you can see why it's called "The White City" (along with other cities in Latin America, such as Arequipa in Peru). Sucre is a beautiful place, with its historic centre a UNESCO World Heritage site. However, it's also incredibly lazy (many places don't open until about 4pm!), and there isn't much to do there. I just passed through Sucre for one day.</p>
