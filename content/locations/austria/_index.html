<p>Austria (known to the locals as <em>Ã–sterreich</em>) is located in the heart of the gorgeous European Alps; it's the undisputed world capital of classical music (and historically, of music in general); and it's one of the countries that &mdash; perhaps more than any other &mdash; sits right on the frontier between eastern and western Europe (although it's definitely part of the west). It's also the only "pure German-speaking" country in the world (i.e. having German as its sole official nationwide language, and spoken by 90%+ of the population), apart from (neighbouring) Germany itself. I came to Austria to soak up some of the culture, to yodel with the locals, and to enjoy some fine alpine skiing.</p>
