<p>Located roughly halfway between Salzburg and Innsbruck, Kitzbühel is a cosy little mountain village that has nowadays evolved into one of Austria's premier ski resorts. Kitzbühel has traditionally been a very relaxed place to ski, but it's been going much more upmarket in recent times. I've been told that it's now considered "the Aspen of Austria" &mdash; however, although you do see a lot of flip-top sports cars and fur-lined coats there, I think that <em>that</em> comparison goes a bit too far. I spent a week here over Christmas, skiing hard all day and partying even harder all night.</p>
