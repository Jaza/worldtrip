<p>Historical capital of the Habsburg Empire, and classical music centre of the world, Vienna (<em>Wien</em> in German) is one of the great cities of Europe &mdash; and although it's rather classy and high-cultured for the drunk Aussie backpacker variety, it is nevertheless high on most Euro backpackers' hit lists. Vienna is a city of grand palaces, wide boulevards, and trendy cafes by the dozen. I popped in for two nights, to check out the sights and to enjoy the Christmas spirit.</p>
