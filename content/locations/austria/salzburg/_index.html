<p>Salzburg has long been one of the star tourist attractions of Austria &mdash; and anyone who's ever visited should understand why. Located in the "sub-alpine" area that borders Bavaria in Germany, the city is best-known for being the home of the story, and the set-location for the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/"><em>The Sound of Music</em></a>; however, there's plenty more to Salzburg than raindrops and roses and warm woollen mittens. It's also the birthplace of Mozart, and is a thriving university city. The city itself is a visual delight, and is surprisingly small and homely &mdash; considering its fame and popularity.</p>
