<p>The Quilotoa area of Ecuador is a string of small villages, set amidst a gorgeous landscape of lush farms and rolling hills, that lies about 2 hours west of the town of Latacunga (between Quito and Baños). The centrepiece of the "Quilotoa Loop" is Laguna Quilotoa, a huge mountain lagoon that occupies an extinct volcano crater. The main village in the loop (for tourists, anyway) is Chugchilán, where I spent two nights, and from where I did a day's hiking.</p>
