<p>Ecuador's capital city (although not its largest), Quito is a modern and well to-do place, located high in the Andean mountains. It's also extremely close to the equator: just a short drive north to "Mitad del Mundo", a big tourist attraction, and a spot that the big line itself passes through. Quito itself is the tourist centre of this country, and it's a great place to relax, to party, and to base yourself for various adventures and excursions.</p>
