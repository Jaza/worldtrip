<p>Little town on the Ecuador side of the Peru-Ecuador border. Not much to do here, except to change buses / taxis when crossing the border (if you need to), and to pass through immigration. Didn't have a chance to explore this place in any great depth, as I was only here for about 1 hour, at 11pm at night.</p>
