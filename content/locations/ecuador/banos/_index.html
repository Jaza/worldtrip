<p>Located a few hours south of Quito &mdash; in Ecuador's central Andean highlands &mdash; Baños is the adventure capital of Ecuador, as well as 100% backpacker's central. You can do everything here, from downhill mountain-biking to rapid river-rafting, and from waterfall canyoning to snow-capped mountain-peak climbing. Also a charming town, surrounded by some really beautiful jungle-covered mountains, and filled with great places to stay and to eat. I spent some time here in Baños, relaxing a bit, but mainly doing a lot of crazy activities.
