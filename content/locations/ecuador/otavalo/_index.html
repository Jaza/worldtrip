<p>Located about 2 hours north from Quito, Otavalo is a lovely little Ecuadorian highland town. The main attraction of Otavalo is its famous traditional handicraft market, which is around all week long, but which is really big on Saturdays. Otavalo has quite a few <em>gringo</em> restaurants and hostels in the town centre, but you can find more than enough local chow and board just a few blocks further out. Great place to relax and to enjoy the <em>ambience</em> for a few days.</p>
