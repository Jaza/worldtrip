<p>Tena is a reasonably big town, on the edge of Ecuador's Amazonian jungle. After a week in Ba√±os, it's a big change in climate: very hot, and very sticky. Due to its abundance of perfectly-suited rivers nearby, Tena is also <em>the</em> place to do rafting and kayaking in Ecuador. I'm not particularly enamoured of the town: but I just came here to do the rafting, so it's the rivers that matter.</p>
