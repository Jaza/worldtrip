<p>Ecuador was the last of the "Andean country trio" that I visited (the other two in the trio being Peru and Bolivia). Ecuador's only a small place, but it packs in an impressive diversity of tropical coastland, rugged mountains, and lush Amazonian rainforest. It's also had such a bumpy economic history, that several years ago the government abolished the national currency (the <em>Sucre</em>), and made the US dollar the only official legal tender in the country. There's a tonne of adventure to be had in Ecuador, as well as a rich culture and a tapestry of communities to be explored.</p>
