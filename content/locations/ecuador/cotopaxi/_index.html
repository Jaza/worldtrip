<p>Located just an hour or two south of Quito, Parque Nacional Cotopaxi is home to the world's highest active volcano, and the second-highest mountain in Ecuador (after Chimborazo): Volcan Cotopaxi (5,897m <abbr title="Above Sea Level">asl</abbr>). The national park is a beautiful and very well-protected place, and the famous volcano within is easily the highlight of its attractions. Great place to go hiking, ice-climbing, and downhill mountain-biking.
