<p>Switzerland's largest city, Zürich is an important part of the country's German-speaking north, and is a beautiful as well as an impeccably clean place. This was my first stop (ever) in the German-speaking world, and I must say it gave me quite a shock to realise that my language skills are almost non-existent here. I mainly came to Zürich to see my uncle and aunt, who have lived here for the past 10 years or so, and who let me stay with them and who showed me around the town.</p>
