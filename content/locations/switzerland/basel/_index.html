<p>Located in the German-speaking "Swiss heartland" of northern Switzerland, Basel is a beautiful and historic city that sits right on the border with both Germany and France. Like Zürich, Basel is immaculately neat and clean, and is also quite chilly at this time of year. I didn't actually spend any nights in Basel; but today, I took a day trip here from Zürich with my uncle Mark, and explored a bit of the city and its museums.</p>
