<p>This once poor and peaceful mountain town is now the gateway to Machu Picchu, and it has been transformed, by this, into an overpriced jungle of tourist facilities, and of tourists. This is where the train to Cusco departs from. This is where the shuttle buses to Machu Picchu leave from, every 5 minutes. And this is where fancy restaurants, stylish hotels, and dressed-up markets rule the roost. Welcome to Aguas Calientes.

<p>Actually, despite all the bitching, I can't deny that Aguas Calientes really is a beautiful town. Its location is gorgeous, with mountains towering over it all around, and with the mighty Rio Urubamba roaring around and through the town. I didn't get a chance to actually visit the nearby hot springs that the town gets its name from; but I hear they're very nice too.</p>
