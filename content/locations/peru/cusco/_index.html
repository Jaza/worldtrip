<p>Few tourists can say that they visited Peru and that they missed Cusco. With more tour agencies, Internet caf√©s, and falafel joints than anywhere else in the country &mdash; and with close proximity to the world-famous Inca ruins of Machu Picchu &mdash; Cusco is <em>the</em> tourist Mecca of South America. I spent a few days here before my Salkantay hike, and I'm spending one month more here, to study some Spanish.</p>
