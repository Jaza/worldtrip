<p>Huaraz is a mountain city in Peru's Cordillera Blanca, and it is the hub of the biggest trekking scene in South America. It's a total mecca for people looking to do treks in the mountains, serious climbing, and other outdoor activities. Beautiful scenery around here, and it's quite a nice city as well.</p>
