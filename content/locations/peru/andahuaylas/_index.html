<p>Andahuaylas is a small Andean town, situated deep in the mountains between Ayacucho and Cusco. I only stopped here for about half an hour, as it was the midpoint of my 24-hour Ayacucho-to-Cusco bus trip. Very scenic area &mdash; the town is in a massive valley, with towering mountains all around &mdash; but not much to do here, and whatever you can do here, I didn't stay long enough to see it.</p>
