<p>The Santa Cruz-Llanganuco trek is located just north of Huaraz, and goes through Peru's highest and most spectacular mountain range, the Cordillera Blanca. The 5-day trek can be done in either direction: I chose to start in the Santa Cruz river valley, and to work my way over to Laguna Llanganuco. Amazing scenery, and the trek is the easiest and the most popular in the Huaraz area.</p>
