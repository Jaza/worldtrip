<p>Situated just below the city of Tumbes, and the Ecuadorian border, Máncora is Peru's biggest (and only significant) beach resort. The beach here isn't quite up to Australian standards: but after more than 4 months without seeing a beach at all, it's pretty good! Máncora is warm all year round (even pretty warm at night), has a plethora of sprawling places to sleep and to eat, and has a party scene that rages all night, every night. Perfect place to relax, after some hard adventuring in the mountains.</p>
