<p>Otherwise known as the <em>City of Kings</em>, Lima is the capital, the oldest city, and the largest city (by far) in Peru. It's also a city of great contrasts, in terms of wealth, culture, and lifestyle. Lima was the first place I visited in Peru, and in the whole of South America. I didn't plan to stay here as long as I did (about 6 days), but because of <em>Semana Santa</em> (Easter Week), I kinda got stuck here.</p>
