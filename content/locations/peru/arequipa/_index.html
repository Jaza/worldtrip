<p>The second-biggest tourist capital in Peru &mdash; after Cusco &mdash; Arequipa is a beautiful, laid-back, and reasonably-priced city to visit. The big attraction in the Arequipa area is the <em>Ca√±on de Colca</em>, a massive and scenic canyon to the city's north, where you can watch wild condors soaring on the winds. There are also volcanoes and mountains to be climbed nearby. Great place to relax for a bit, to get out and party some, and to have some wild adventures.</p>
