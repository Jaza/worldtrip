<p>Ica is a nice town near the coast of Peru, several hours south of Lima. The area around Ica is famous for having the finest wineries and Pisco-producing farms in the country. There is also the sand-dune resort oasis of Huacachina, just 5 minutes out of Ica. A very different place from the rest of southern Peru, which is mainly known for its mountain towns.</p>
