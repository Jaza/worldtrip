<p>Just as Arica is hugging the southern side of the Peru-Chilean border, so too is Tacna hugging its northern side. It's just an hour's ride, in a shared taxi, from Arica to Tacna; lots of Chileans hop over here for a few hours, to do some cheap shopping. Not very much to see here, and it has a bit of a bad reputation; but it's worth stopping here for an hour or two, before heading off to wherever else it is that you're going.</p>
