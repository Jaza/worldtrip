<p>Coastal Chiclayo is one of the main cities in the north of Peru. It's famous for having a number of significant nearby archaeological ruins, including those of Sipán. Chiclayo is quite a relaxed place: it has a great atmosphere, and it's a very nice city to hang around in and to explore at your leisure. Also has great food, including fruit and ice-cream cafés everywhere, and a plethora of <em>ceviche</em> (raw seafood) restaurants.</p>
