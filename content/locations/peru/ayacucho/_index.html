<p>Situated in the heart of Peru's Andean highlands, 9 hours east of Lima, Ayacucho is a beautiful, not-too-touristed town with a colourful history. Ayacucho is <em>the</em> place to be on <em>Semana Santa</em> (Easter), as it's a very religious place (packed with over 30 churches &mdash; one on every corner), and as it's famous for its big Easter celebrations. It was also the home of Peru's <em>Sendero Luminoso</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Path">Shining Path</a>) terrorists, before they were stamped out in the early 90s.
</p>
<p>I made it to Ayacucho for the tail end of <em>Semana Santa</em>, and then stayed for a few days after. My main reason for coming here was to see my friend-of-a-friend, <a href="/blog/abimael-riveros">Abimael Riveros</a>, who lives and works here.
</p>
<p>The mountainous surroundings, the quaint town, and the friendly people, all combine to make this a beautiful place. Plus, it's in the heart of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua">Quechua</a>-speaking Peru, so it's also a great place to pick up a few words of South America's most widely spoken indigenous language.</p>
