<p>Amantaní is one of the islands on the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca. It's generally reached via a boat ride of about 4 hours, from Puno. Slightly less touristed than its not-too-distant neighbour of Taquile, it's a quiet island, with almost no commerce, and inhabited almost entirely by traditional farmers. I spent one night on Amantaní, staying with one of the farming families.
