<p>A very small town, with one very big tourist attraction: the famous Nazca lines &mdash; mysterious lines created by the ancient people here, which stretch across the surrounding desert, and which form the shapes of animals and geometric figures when seen from the air. Nobody stays here more than one night, if that: I just stopped here for a quick morning flight over the lines, in between a night bus from Arequipa, and a day bus on to Ica and Huacachina.</p>
