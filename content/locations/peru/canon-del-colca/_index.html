<p>The Colca Canyon (or <em>Cañon del Colca</em>) is one of the world's deepest canyons, located just north of Arequipa. With its steep walls, its terraced farms, its remote mountainside villages, and its rich plant and animal life, it is an amazingly beautiful place. It's most famous for its wild condors, which can be seen soaring through the canyon early in the morning. I hiked through the canyon on a three-day trip.
