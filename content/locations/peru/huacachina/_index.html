<p>Huacachina has to be the most bizarre resort town I've ever seen. Resorts are usually situated on tropical beaches: but Huacachina &mdash; just outside the city of Ica on the coast of Peru &mdash; is a tiny collection of resorts that hug a little lagoon oasis, and that is otherwise completely surrounded by massive sand dunes. Anyway, very pleasant and very relaxing place to hang out, after a hectic trip along the <em>gringo</em> trail.</p>
