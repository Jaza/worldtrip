<p>Nevado Salkantay rises 6271m above sea level, making it one of the highest mountains in the Cusco area. The Salkantay area is where I completed a 5-day hike to Machu Picchu, going through jungle, pastures, and swampy valleys along the way. It's a beautiful and starkly majestic area, and it manages to be both pristine in its wilderness qualities, and intriguing with its hardy locals and their traditional lifestyles, all at once.
