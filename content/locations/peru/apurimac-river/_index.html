<p>Located about four hours northwest of Cusco, the <em>Río Apurímac</em> is a massive, often rapid river that begins near Arequipa in southern Peru, and that flows through steep gorges through much of the mountains, before eventually flowing down into the jungle, and forming the largest of all tributaries that feed the mighty Amazon. I went on a rafting trip down the Río Apurímac for three days, going through the deep valley that it forms, and having an awesome time on the rapids.
