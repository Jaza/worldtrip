<p>Situated on the western shore of Lake Titicaca &mdash; the world's highest navigable lake &mdash; Puno is a pleasant little town with a seaside feel. It's actually a fairly big place: but like most <em>gringos</em>, I only explored the small and all-touristy city centre, and the docks. Puno is the gateway to the islands on the Peruvian side of the lake, including Los Uros, Amantan√≠, and Taquile.
