<p>Located on the edge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_National_Park">Parque Nacional del Manu</a>, in the park's "cultural zone", Pilcopata is a sleepy little village at the fringe of the Peruvian part of the mighty Amazon jungle. I spent two days in Pilcopata, on a jungle tour with some of my friends from <a href="/blog/chocco-and-hampy-tour">Hampy</a>.</p>
