<p>The Netherlands (otherwise known as Holland) is a very low and a very flat country &mdash; and of course it's the home of the Dutch. Famous for a long history of being socially liberal and super-progressive, the Netherlands is also home to bicycle mania, legal soft drugs, and ocean-stopping dykes. I popped in here between Belgium and Germany, on my lightning December train tour of Europe.</p>
