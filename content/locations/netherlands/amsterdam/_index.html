<p>As far as backpacking goes in Europe, it seems that Amsterdam is one of those places that <em>nobody</em> is prepared to miss. Amsterdam is an architecturally beautiful city &mdash; with its meandering canals and its squashed-in houses &mdash; and it also boasts plenty of history to be explored. But, of course, most people visit the city for the things that make it <em>really</em> famous: soft narcotic drugs (i.e. cannabis, hashish, and magic mushrooms) legally available everywhere; and Europe's biggest and most famous whore-lined red light district. Like everyone else, I just came here to have a good time.</p>
