<p>Entering Palenque feels not only like stepping into a different country; it feels like stepping into another dimension. Palenque is a fantasy universe where everyone is relaxed and at peace; where everything around you is a natural, beautiful, living jungle; where it's easy to forget that anything at all in the world is bad; and where wearing a watch really doesn't make any sense. If you really want to understand the magic of Palenque, you'll just have to go and see it for yourself.

<p>I spent two nights at Palenque, with my hammock slung up at the jungle retreat of <em>El Panch√°n</em>. If I wasn't running so desperately short on time here in Mexico, I would have stayed at least a week. As it was, I just had time to relax, to discover inner peace in a way I'd never before thought possible, and to check out the spectacular Maya ruins of the ancient city of Palenque.</p>
