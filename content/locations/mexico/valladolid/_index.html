<p>There's something about this sleepy little waypoint town that I really like. Despite the fact that there isn't much to do here, it's cheap and relaxed, and the people are very friendly. I spent two nights here, on my way from Mérida to Playa Del Carmen; but if I had more time to spare, I would have been happy staying longer.
</p>
<p>Valladolid's main selling points are that it connects the coasts of the Yucatán; and that it's the nearest big town to Chichén Itzá. I went to Chichén Itzá from here. It was really hot in Valladolid when I was here. It's also a great place to rent a bicycle, but unfortunately, I didn't get round to doing that.

<p>Oh, and did I mention that it took me 5 days before I could say the word <em>Valladolid</em> correctly?</p>
