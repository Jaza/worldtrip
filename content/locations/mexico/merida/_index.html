<p>I wasn't planning on staying in Mérida &mdash; I was going to just head straight on to Valladolid &mdash; but I'm glad that I ended up spending two nights here. Mérida is the gateway to the Yucatán Peninsula. It's very safe, fairly sleepy, quite hot, and a bit on the expensive side. It also has great people to meet at its hostels, and it has impressive Maya ruins, such as Uxmal, relatively nearby.

<p>I'd heard that Mérida is a city of fine arts and of classical entertainment, and that this has led to the people being a bit on the snobbish side, and to food being a bit on the expensive side. Unfortunately, this is all true: but it wasn't as bad as I anticipated. It's still possible to have some cheap, uncultured fun in Mérida, if you know where to look.</p>
