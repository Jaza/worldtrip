<p>This rich and exotic city was the first stop on my year-long adventure. Mexico City is really, really big. From my aeroplane window, it stretched out below me, sprawling to the horizon in every direction. It's also a really friendly place, with locals that are always happy to give directions (which is great if you can understand what they're saying!), or to just drop what they're doing and to join you for a beer.</p>
