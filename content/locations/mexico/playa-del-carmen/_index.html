<p>If you want an absolutely stunning beach at your front door, then you can't go past Playa Del Carmen. It is the <em>playa</em> to whip all other <em>playas</em>. The water is warm and clear and a shiny bright blue. The sand is fine and soft. The <em>chicas</em> are everywhere. And the beachside town is not (yet) built-up enough to be a monstrocity &mdash; unlike Cancun to the north &mdash; but it's certainly built-up enough for you to party all night long.

<p>I spent two nights in <em>Playa</em> (as it's called round here), choosing to stay at the hostel, rather than by the beach in a hammock. Ah well, plenty of time for that stuff at Tulum and Palenque.</p>
