<p>I only stopped here briefly, in between my trip from Veracruz, and my trip to Merida (both of which were by bus). It seems like a friendly enough place, but basically, there's no reason for tourists to come here. It's a very plain city, the centre of Mexico's oil industry, and a bit of an industrial wasteland.

<p>Nice tacos, though.</p>
