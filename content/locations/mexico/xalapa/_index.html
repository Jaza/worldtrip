<p>About 5 hours east of Mexico City, Xalapa is a refreshingly safe and relaxed place. Despite having 0.5 million residents, the few streets in central Xalapa have a bohemian, small-town feel to them.
</p>
<p>From the main Zocalo in Xalapa, there are some breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside, including the snow-capped peak of Mexico's highest mountain. Also, the weather is fine, the air is richer (than in Mexico City), and the pollution levels are lower.
</p>
<p>I'm only staying here 2 nights, but if I had more time in Mexico, I could easily spend a week here, as my friend <a href="/blog/steve-from-jersey">Steve from Jersey</a> is doing. There isn't that much to do here, but nevertheless, there's something about Xalapa that makes you want to hang around a bit longer.</p>
