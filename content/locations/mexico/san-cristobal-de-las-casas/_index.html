<p>San Cristóbal is easily one of the most beautiful towns in Mexico. With colonial architecture dating back 400 years, gorgeous mountains all around, and every daytime facility and nighttime party hangout you could ask for, it's easy to see why everyone told me that I must visit this place. It's also the coldest place I've visited in Mexico, due to its altitude of over 2000 metres above sea level.

<p>I spent two nights here in San Cristóbal, and I found it to be a great place to take it easy and to fix up various odds and ends for a while. There isn't that much to do in town during the day &mdash; which is why numerous tours are available to take you to nearby sights and sounds &mdash; but the town itself is so quaint, that it warrants at least a few hours spent wandering around, getting a feel for the place.</p>
