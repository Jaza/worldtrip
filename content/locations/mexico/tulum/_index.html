<p>About an hour south of <em>Playa</em>, Tulum is a laid-back little town, as well as a (fairly nearby) beautiful caba√±a-lined beach (with nice ruins adjacent to the beach as well). Tulum is much less built-up than <em>Playa</em>, and is a hangout for many more hippies. I spent 3 nights in town, and another 3 on the beachfront in my hammock. Very relaxing.
