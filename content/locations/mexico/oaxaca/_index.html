<p>Oaxaca (pronounced <em>"wa-<strong>hu</strong>kka"</em>) is a beautiful city, but unfortunately, I only left myself one day to see it. I don't know why Oaxaca is <a href="http://smarttraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/Mexico">listed by DFAT as a dangerous city</a>, or why it's reported to be a poverty-stricken or a dirty city, because it is none of these things. It has a beautiful historic centre, great markets, and really good food. All I can say to you, Oaxaca, is this: sorry, and I hope I can see you properly next time.
