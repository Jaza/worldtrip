<p>Situated about 80% of the way down between San Francisco and San Jose, and in the heart of the world's first and biggest (and only true) Silicon Valley, Sunnyvale is a suburban sleepytown filled with some of the most hi-tech corporate head offices on the planet. I spent several days down here, for the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">OSCMS Summit 2007</a> (of which DrupalCon was a big part), which was hosted at the massive campus that is the Yahoo! world headquarters.</p>
