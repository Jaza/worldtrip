<p><em>I was born there.</em> No I wasn't, actually: I just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_IV:_The_Voyage_Home">felt like saying that</a>. The last time I was in San Francisco was almost 7 years ago, and it's even more beautiful than I remember it. So much greenness, so much hilliness, and <em>such</em> a beautiful bay and bridge! This time, I spent a good 7 nights in the city, with 3 days being spent relaxing and cycling, and the other 4 days being spent at <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">DrupalCon</a>, down in lovely Sunnyvale.
