<p>The centre of the world. Need I say more, or is that not a sufficient description of New York &mdash; one of the biggest, the liveliest, the craziest, and the most colourful cities known to man? After seven years, it's good to be back in the Big Apple. And it's good to see that, although a group of lunatics managed to destroy one of the city's most famous landmarks back in 2001, they failed to destroy even the teeniest fragment of New York's beautiful, and 100% unique, vibe and culture. Its heart and soul.</p>
