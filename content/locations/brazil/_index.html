<p>Land of sun-soaked beaches, all-night parties, ice-cool <em>capirinhas</em>, and irresistable women: Brazil is the dream destination of every South American traveller, and it's also my grand finale stop on this continent. Brazil is an enormous country &mdash; most of which is taken up by the never-ending Amazon rainforest &mdash; and apart from the fact that they speak Portuguese there (and that some of its cities are really dangerous), nobody should have any excuse for missing it in their Latin travels.</p>
