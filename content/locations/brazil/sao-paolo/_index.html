<p>The sprawling "megalopolis" of São Paulo is Brazil's &mdash; and South America's &mdash; largest city. The place holds few attractions for the average tourist, but due to its being the transport hub of Brazil, it's pretty hard to avoid passing through it at least once. I spent tonight in São Paulo, in between my bus ride from Ilha Grande and my plane out of here &mdash; and I think that's about as much of it as I needed to see.</p>
