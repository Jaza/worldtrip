<p>Located about 4 hours west of Rio (by bus and by boat), Ilha Grande is &mdash; as its name suggests &mdash; a big island. And a beautiful one, too. Apart from untouched tropical rainforests, gorgeous beaches, and fish-filled bays perfect for diving and snorkelling, Ilha Grande is also home to several charming little villages, and numerous places for cheap and classy tourists alike to sleep and to enjoy themselves. Once I realised that I just wasn't in the mood for the enormity and the madness of Rio, I ducked over here for a super-relaxing final few days in South America.</p>
