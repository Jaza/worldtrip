<p>Foz is the town on the Brazilian side of the South American "tri-border" area (shared by Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay), and the gateway to Brazil's share of the colossal Iguazu Falls. Foz was the first place I visited in Brazil (after crossing from Puerto Iguazú in Argentina), and it's a nice, laid-back introduction to this utterly crazy country.</p>
