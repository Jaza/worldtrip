<p>The city of Frankfurt (full name "Frankfurt am Main") is one of the largest cities in Germany, and is the economic and transportation centre of the nation. Frankfurt is well-known by most people as "somewhere you go on a business trip", "somewhere you change planes at the airport" (since so many flights go through here, and since it's often cheaper to fly via here), or simply "somewhere with tall buildings". Although that does pretty much sum up modern Frankfurt, it is also a city with a rich history, a vibrant cultural scene, and one of Europe's nightlife meccas. My reason for coming here was one of the above: I just stayed here for one night, in order to catch a cheap flight to Madrid the next morning.</p>
