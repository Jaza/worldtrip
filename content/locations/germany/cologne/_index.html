<p>Located in the most densely populated area of Germany, Cologne (Köln in German) is among the most beautiful of all German cities, and hence has always been a very popular stop for tourists. Cologne is most famous for "The Dom" &mdash; its stunning cathedral in the centre of the city &mdash; which is the largest work of Gothic architecture in all of Europe. Kölsch beer is another important reason to visit. I spent one night here in Cologne, mainly to visit my friend Regine (who lives in nearby Bonn).</p>
