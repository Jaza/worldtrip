<p>Munich (<em>MÃ¼nchen</em> in German) is one of the most famous and (for tourists) most popular cities in Germany, as well as the capital of the state of Bavaria. Munich is most renowned for two things: giant <em>bratwurst</em> sausages; and the world's best beer (and, not so coincidentally, the world's biggest annual beer-guzzling festival &mdash; Oktoberfest). However, Munich is also one of the oldest and most historically significant cities in modern Germany: until the 1870s, it was the capital of the independent Bavaria, which was the wealthiest of the old Germany city-states; for almost 1,000 years, it's been an important centre of trade and commerce, as well as a staunchly religious Catholic centre; and more recently, it was the birthplace and the support base of the Nazi party. Munich is also utterly infested with Aussies &mdash; even outside of October.</p>
