<p>Germany is one of the largest and most central countries in Europe, and it's been a classic backpacker's destination for yonks. Home of giant bratwurst sausages, sleek and powerful luxury automobiles (and incredible roads to complement them), and Bavarian beers by the <em>stein</em>, every corner of the land offers something just a little bit different. All connected by an efficient train network, that runs on time to-the-second, in that grand tradition of German efficiency. Just <strong>don't mention the war!</strong></p>
