<p>Freiburg (full name Freiburg im Breisgau) is a charming and laid-back town, in the south-western region of Germany known as Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. The town's roots date back to Medieval times, when it was largely under Austrian control, and when it was an important commercial centre in the area. I visited Freiburg for one night &mdash; mainly just to see my friend Gerhard, who lives here.</p>
