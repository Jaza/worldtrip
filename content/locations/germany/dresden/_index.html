<p>Bombed to smithereens. That's what Dresden is famous for. On February 14, 1945, Allied bombers dropped several thousand tonnes onto this beautiful but doomed city: and overnight, over 80% of the city was reduced to rubble, and tens of thousands of its inhabitants (and others) were killed. That's all I knew about Dresden, before visiting: I always thought of it as "that place that they bombed". Dresden is one of the finest cities in (what was formerly) East Germany, and today the city has been almost completely rebuilt (much of the rebuilding being authentic restoration, no less). I spent just one night here &mdash; mainly to visit my friend Katharina, who lives here &mdash; and I was blown away by how miraculously the place has recovered from near-total annihilation during WWII, and from a subsequent 45 years of Soviet rule.</p>
