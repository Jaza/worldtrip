<p>Berlin is one of Europe's most paradoxical cities: proud yet divided; modern yet scarred; and high-cultured yet cheap and friendly. For almost half a century, Berlin was split into capitalist East and communist West; and although the famous wall has been gone since 1989, the city still has much recovery and integration yet to complete. For backpackers, Berlin boasts a plethora of important sights, a raging big-city nightlife, and ridiculously cheap prices. No way I'd miss a place like this.</p>
