<p>Chile is the world's longest north-to-south country, and it's one of the most expensive, the most developed, and the most westernised of all the countries in South America. The north of Chile consists mainly of the Atacama desert, which is statistically the driest place on Earth. In the middle lies the capital, Santiago; while to the south lie the prime trekking spots of Torres Del Paine, and Tierra Del Fuego. I crossed into Chile for the first time from Bolivia, and seeing these two countries in one day was like seeing two different and completely alien worlds.</p>
