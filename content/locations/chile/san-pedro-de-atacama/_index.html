<p>A small oasis town in the middle of Chile's Atacama desert (the driest place on Earth), San Pedro de Atacama is a tiny place with a lot of tourists. It has nearby attractions such as sandboarding on the desert dunes, and seeing the Valle de la Luna (Moon Valley). I did the popular route of reaching San Pedro from Bolivia (it's quite close to the border), after finishing my tour of the Salar de Uyuni.</p>
