<p>Iquique is a big town on the coast of Northern Chile, just next to the massive Atacama desert. Although Iquique hails itself as a "beach resort town", it's more of a wannabe beach location, since it's not that warm most of the year, and since its beaches really aren't that good (well, maybe they are by Chilean standards &mdash; but not by Aussie standards!). Nice place to hang out and relax for a bit; but not much to do here.</p>
