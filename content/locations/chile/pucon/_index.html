<p>The small town of Puc贸n is the most popular tourist destination, on the Chilean side of the famous South American "lake district". Although it's not at a very high altitude, and although it rarely snows in the town, it looks and feels very much like an alpine ski village. I came here to Puc贸n in winter, when it gets decidedly chilly, and when it's nice and quiet, bereft of the hordes that descend upon it in the summer. There are many adventure activities to do around Puc贸n, the main one being to climb Villarrica volcano.</p>
