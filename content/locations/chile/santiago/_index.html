<p>The capital and the largest city in Chile, Santiago is one of South America's most modern metropolises. Compared with the cities that I've grown used to further north (e.g. in Peru and Bolivia), Santiago is very modern and very beautiful. With its tree-lined boulevards, its trendy caf√©s, and its public lawns filled with lounging uni students, Santiago feels like it should be in Europe, or perhaps in the USA's New England area. Also very polluted, and a bit cold at this time of year.</p>
