<p>Arica is Chile's northernmost city, almost touching the nation's Peruvian border. It's quite a big place, although not the most exciting city in the world. Bit of a funny mix between Chilean orderliness, and Peruvian chaos. Spent a bit of time here in transit, on my way north to Arequipa in Peru.</p>
