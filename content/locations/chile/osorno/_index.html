<p>Fairly uninteresting town in the Lake District of Chile, between Puc√≥n and Puerto Montt. The only reason that I passed through this town, is because from here, there's a road that crosses the Chile/Argentina border, and that goes straight to Bariloche. So I had to make a bus connection here. The place is sleepy, average, and lacking in any memorable attractions.</p>
