<p>Wil's been studying at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a> with me (but not in my class) for the past two weeks; and he's also involved with the volunteer group <a href="http://hampy.org/">Hampy</a>, that I went <a href="/blog/chocco-and-hampy-tour">on a little tour</a> with today. Wil's an American from Upstate New York, and he's been travelling in South America for quite a while already, so his Spanish is quite good. He's got a girlfriend from Chile, and from the sound of things, their relationship is pretty serious. He's a quiet guy, but he's very genuine, and he's doing great work with the kids at Hampy, helping them work out how to find employment.</p>
