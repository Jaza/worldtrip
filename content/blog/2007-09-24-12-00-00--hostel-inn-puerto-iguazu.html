<p>This place is famous as the best place to stay, on either side of Iguazu Falls (Brazilian or Argentinean). It was recommended to me by several people in Buenos Aires &mdash; and it's so big and so full of tourists, it seems that I'm not the only one that got a recommendation about it. Everyone in town comes here! And with a BBQ dinner every night, live entertainment in the evenings, free Internet and Wi-Fi, a big well-stocked bar, daily tours to the falls, and a huge swimming pool, why would you go anywhere else? The place is more like a resort than a hostel, really. Considering that it only costs about US$10 a night, it's a ridiculously nice place for a travel-weary backpacker to crash at. <a href="http://www.hostel-inn.com/">Hostel Inn</a>: a part of the <a href="http://www.hostels.org.ar/">Hostelling International</a> network.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> quite comfortable, located downstairs and away from the noisy bar and common area, and not too crowded.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> every man and his dog that's come to see Iguazu Falls is staying here. Backpackers from near and far, a few families, a few couples, a bit of everyone really.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> very professional, all English-speaking, and available all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> not the greatest &mdash; a fair way out of town, so you have to get a bus or a taxi to/from the place &mdash; but at least it's quiet and peaceful out here.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> great buffet breakfast of cereal, bread, fruit, and tea / coffee / juice. Plus, the all-you-can-eat BBQ dinners are sensational: see how much <em>asado</em> (beef) you can stuff yourself with!</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 5 PCs with a good connection (actually 5 isn't that many, considering how many people there are here). Plus, plenty of laptop-owners take advantage of the Wi-Fi.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> strong and reliable.</p>
