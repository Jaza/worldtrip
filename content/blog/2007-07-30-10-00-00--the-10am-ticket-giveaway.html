<p>Went shopping around this morning, for a ticket on a night bus north to Trujillo. Got to the terminal of a company called Linea at 9:45am, and was given some hilarious news. Their 9pm bus to Trujillo was booked out for tonight: but they had 5 reserved seats that hadn't yet been paid for; and if nobody came and paid for them by 10am, they'd give them away first-come first-serve. So I took the advice of the guy at the desk, and waited for 15 minutes. By 10am, two reserved seats had been claimed, but the other three were up for grabs. I grabbed one of them, fast.</p>

So I took the advice of the guy at the desk, and waited for 15 minutes. By 10am, two reserved seats had been claimed, but the other three were up for grabs. I grabbed one of them, fast.</p>
<p>Very strange system that they have here &mdash; but I guess it's relatively normal, as "systems" in this part of the world go. Apparently, every morning they get a mob of people coming in just before 10am, to try and grab any unpaid-for reserved seats on the bus to Trujillo. I didn't know about this occurrence: I was just very lucky, to stumble into the right place, at exactly the right time! Of course, they have other buses to Trujillo: but they're much more expensive, since they're semi-cama and cama services, and they never sell out; everyone wants the cheap and very basic 9pm service.</p>
<p>So, tonight I'm off to Trujillo! I'm going with Linea, because unlike some of the other companies (e.g. Movil Tours, the guys that I came to Huaraz with), they also have buses every hour (from 6am onwards) from Trujillo to Chiclayo. Since I don't want to stop in Trujillo &mdash; I want to go straight on, further north to Chiclayo (everyone says that Chiclayo is nicer, and I don't really have time for both of them) &mdash; this suits me perfectly. Unfortunately, nobody has buses direct from Huaraz to Chiclayo &mdash; you have to connect in the big city of Trujillo. Oh well, at least I can make my connection with the same company, at the same terminal in Trujillo.</p>
