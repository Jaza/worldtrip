<p>When I arrived in Mollepata this morning (starting point of the Salkantay hike), there was a little girl running around inside the restaurant there. I asked her: <em>"¿Como te llamas, chica pocita?"</em> (lit: <em>"What's your name, little girl?"</em>); and she replied without hesitation: <em>"Jasmine America"</em>. Oh-kay, whatever! Jasmine was eager to show me her puppies (in the back yard), and her set of barbie dolls. Very sweet girl &mdash; she reminded me of my little sisters back home. But, oy: if that's her real name, she's gonna score a few laughs in her lifetime!</p>
