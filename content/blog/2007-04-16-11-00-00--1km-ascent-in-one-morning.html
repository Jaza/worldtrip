<p>I knew that today, day 2 of the <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">Salkantay hike</a>, was going to be tough; but nothing could have prepared me for the massive ascent that we made this morning, from Soraypampa to the edge of Nevado Salkantay.

<p>I knew that today, day 2 of the <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">Salkantay hike</a>, was going to be tough; but nothing could have prepared me for the massive ascent that we made this morning, from Soraypampa to the edge of Nevado Salkantay.

<p>The hardest part of the ascent was a seemingly never-ending windy dirt path, that made its way up a cliff-like mountainside in one giant zigzag. They really do love their windy zigzag mountain paths, here in Peru. But hey, I guess it's better than trying to walk up a cliff. A few of the crazier people in the group (such as me) went all the way up this bastard in one go, with ne'er a pause or a break of any kind; others took it a bit slower. Either way, we all made it up.</p>

<p><em>About as winding and as steep a path as you'll find anywhere in this world.</em></p>
<p>After the zigzag, we stopped for a little break on top of a big, flat rock, situated just beside a serene, high-altitude little lagoon. There, we waited for everyone to catch up, we had some welcome morning tea, and we took some group photos.</p>

<p>Then, it was all steam ahead for the rest of the ascent, until we made it to Paso Salkantay itself &mdash; the highest point in our whole hike. Obviously, being an auspicious occasion and all, getting to the top warranted an extended bout of group photo-taking, snacking, and even a bit of the world-famous <a href="/blog/the-australian-belgian-salute">Australian-Belgian Salute</a>. The only thing that we really didn't have an extended amount of was oxygen: at such high altitude, we were all finding it a bit hard to breathe, and I was feeling decidedly light-headed. But nobody had any serious medical problems as a result of the altitude, thank G-d.</p>

<p><em>Yeahhh, we made it!</em></p>
<p>According to Felix, the word "Salkantay" means "unfriendly" in Quechua; so the mountain we were next to literally is named "unfriendly mountain". Only one group has ever made it to the top of Salkantay itself; another group (of professional mountaineers) tried a few years ago, and almost all of them were killed by an avalanche. As for us <em>gringos</em>, we just climb to the adjacent pass, and look on at the forbidding mountain above us.</p>
