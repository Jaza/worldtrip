<p>Basic guest-house kind of place, in the historic centre of Ayacucho. <a href="/blog/cath-and-gaz">Cath, Gaz</a>, and myself rocked up here at 7am this morning, and we managed to get a room each (one for me, one for them). I think that this is about the closest Ayacucho has to proper youth hostels: it has shared bathrooms, but no dorms.</p>
<p>Also, from now on, I'm adding a new field to accommodation reviews: hot water. Up until now, this is something I've been able to take for granted, wherever I stay. But that's no longer the case. :P</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> basic, but secure and private.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> you don't really see the other guests.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> friendly, but their Spanish is incomprehensible (weird accent + mumbling). Also, one of them tried to snog Cath.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> middle of town, perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> none.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> present, but unreliable.</p>
