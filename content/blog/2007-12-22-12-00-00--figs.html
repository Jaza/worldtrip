<p>I was walking through the Christmas market in Salzburg this afternoon, with <a href="/blog/lisa-from-dc">Lisa</a>, when I couldn't help but notice some dried figs for sale in a stall. This wouldn't have been such a noteworthy moment, were it not for a little fact that Lisa explained to me <a href="/blog/climb-every-mountain-do-every-tour">earlier today</a>: the word "fig" (with different spelling?) is apparently quite a rude word in German. If you tell someone you want a "fig" in Germany, then you will supposedly receive a stinging slap on the face. Anyway, they weren't labelled "figs", they were labelled with the equivalent German word "feigen": but hey, that sounds like a few other things in <em>English</em>, doesn't it now? Clearly, the fig is simply a dirty fruit, no matter what language you name it in.</p>
