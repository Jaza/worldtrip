<p>In case I haven't yet had my full <a href="/blog/adi-and-maria">dose</a> of <a href="/blog/the-only-gay-on-the-island">Austrians</a>, tonight Ko Tao delivered me yet more of them! Iris and Andrea are two lovely girls from Vienna, who are (like myself) currently on a world trip &mdash; although theirs is significantly shorter than mine. They've already been to Australia, where the only place they visited was Sydney (they reckon it was so much fun, they got stuck there for two weeks &mdash; go figure). They're currently taking their sweet time getting through Thailand's glorious south, after which they'll keep heading north, and eventually home. I bumped into them at the hippie bar next-door to my room this evening, where I shared a few drinks with them.</p>

<p><em>Iris and Andrea: don't mind Andrea, she has an eye infection at the moment, and it doesn't look too flattering. Normally, her right eye is just as beautiful as the rest of her.</em></p>
