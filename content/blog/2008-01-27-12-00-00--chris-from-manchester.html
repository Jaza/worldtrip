<p>Chris is a tall, long-haired, opinionated lad from Manchester, that great urban centre of northern England. He's one of my comrades in the <a href="/blog/padi-diving-course-begins">Open Water course</a> that I'm currently doing: and like me, he's finding diving to be challenging yet rewarding. Chris has a wicked sense of humour; but what makes me crack up everytime he speaks, more than anything, is his positively kick-a$$ super-strength Manchester accent. Chris is here in Thailand for a while &mdash; and if he likes it enough, he may just spend the majority of his Thai time right here on Ko Tao.</p>
