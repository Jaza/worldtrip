<p>I met these two guys this evening in (where else but) the bar at <a href="/blog/yoho-hostel-salzburg">Yoho</a>. Thierry's a bearded <em>Québécois</em> from Canada, who adores Mozart &mdash; and since Salzburg is Mozart's home town, he's in paradise. Wilson's on holiday from Hong Kong, and he is (with no success that we're aware of) looking for a local European girl to have some fun with. I had some drinks with these guys at Yoho, and I went exploring with them the next day.</p>
