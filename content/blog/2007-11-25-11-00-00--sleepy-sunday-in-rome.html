<p>Happy birthday old boy! Wanted to send you this on your birthday but yur mum was away and out of reach by phone and I couldn't remember your address.
</p>
<p>So you're in sunny, steamy Thailand. Are you going to Ko Chang? We're looking at going there next December. Supposed to be beautiful and relatively untouched (compared wtih ugly Phuket).
</p>
<p>The kids want to know if cousin Jeremy can buy them a couple of DVD's, so let us know if you have room.
</p>
<p>Looking very forward to seeing all your photos (though we've alredy seen tons) and hearing about your adventures. 4 weeks to the Barmi - believe your'e returning the morning before - boy are you going to out of sorts and feeling really weird - don't worry, it'll pass in about 2 months of being back in reality.
</p>
<p>Love linda et al.</p>

<p>It was a good day to do very little, anyway. The weather was grim all day: raining on-and-off, as well as being quite cold. Apart from the fact that I already spent half the day there yesterday, the Vatican was also out of the question today: as the pope was giving a public blessing in St. Peter's square, I hear the masses packed the square in full force (and got soaked in the rain); plus, since it's the last Sunday of the month, the Vatican Museum and the Sistine Chapel were open for free &mdash; hence, yesterday's massive queue and sardine-packed crowds would have been nothing compared to today's. The only other big thing on today was the market at Porto Portese (which is big every Sunday): but the rain would have made the market less than amazing; I've <a href="/blog/bicycle-and-accessories">already seen plenty of Porto Portese</a> before; and the Sunday scene there is meant to be rife with pickpockets (and I've had quite enough theft for one weekend, thank you very much).</p>
