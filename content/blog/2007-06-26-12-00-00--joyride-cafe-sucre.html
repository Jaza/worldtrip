<p>As I discovered at <a href="/blog/parque-cretacico">Parque Cretácico</a> this morning, there really isn't much to do in Sucre. For some reason, absolutely nothing &mdash; not cafés, not general stores, not pharmacies &mdash; seems to be open before about 4pm. It's a totally lazy and useless place. There's nothing at all to do in town, during the day. Nothing, that is, except hang out at the <a href="http://www.joyridebol.com/">Joyride Café</a>, the No. 1 <em>gringo</em> haunt in town, and the only place that actually is open when you need it to be. That's how we ended up spending breakfast, lunch, dinner, and most of the time in between in Sucre, sitting in the Joyride Café. Nice place: but Sucre could certainly use a few more places to eat and, well, do something.</p>
