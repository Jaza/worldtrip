<p>The Mérida area is famous for being the best place in Mexico to buy hammocks. The good Mexican hammocks are the ones that hark back to an ancient Mayan tradition: hand-made; dyed with natural, local plant products; and woven from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisal">sisal</a> fibres that are easily obtained from the native cactus plants.

<p>Got it for 700 pesos (USD$70), down from 1,200. <em>Lonely Planet</em> says that less than USD$100 is a pretty good deal, as long as it's genuine. And I'm pretty sure it is.</p>

<p><em>My new sisal hammock.</em></p>
<p>The shopkeeper claims that his hammocks will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last at least 20 years.</li>
<li>Naturally repel mosquitoes.</li>
<li>Survive machine washing.</li>
<li>Survive rain and other severe weather.</li>
</ul>
<p>Time will tell the validity of these claims. I'm planning to spend a few nights in my new hammock, on the beach at Tulum, and in the jungle at Palenque. These will be good opportunities to give my new hammock a baptism.</p>
<p>Sorry &mdash; I mean <em>bris</em>.</p>
