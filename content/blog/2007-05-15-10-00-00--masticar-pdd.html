<p>The verb <em>masticar</em> simply means "to chew". It's quite similar to the English word "masticate", of the same meaning; except that unlike the English word, it generally isn't confused with another word of similar sound, but of a very different meaning :P. If you go to a <em>parrillada</em> (Argentinean steak house), and you get a particularly tough piece  of meat, then you might think to yourself <em>"voy a tener que masticarlo por mucho tiempo"</em> (lit: "I'm going to have to chew this for a while"). Note that in Spanish, they have a different word for "chewing-gum": they call it <em>chicle</em>.</p>
