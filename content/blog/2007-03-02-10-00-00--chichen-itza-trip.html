<p>A group of us from Valladolid got to Chichén Itzá at about 9:30am; and it was lucky we got there early, because 2 hours later, the entry queue was over 30 metres long.

<p>The pyramid at Chichén Itzá is massive and monumental, but you can't climb it. Apparently, someone fell down it about 2 years ago, and it's been closed ever since.

<p>Probably the worst thing about Chichén Itzá is that they let peddlers into the site itself; so that wherever you go, people have set up "markets", and are trying to sell you massively overpriced rubbish. Some guy was trying to sell me a foot-square leather wall hanging for 250 pesos. What a ripoff. I only bothered bargaining him down to 200, before I walked away without buying it.

<p>However, having said all of this, the ruins themselves are very nice, and are worth seeing.
</p>
<p>There's also a great, natural pool on the edge of Chichén Itzá, which doesn't look swimmable (or accessible, for that matter), but which is very pretty.
