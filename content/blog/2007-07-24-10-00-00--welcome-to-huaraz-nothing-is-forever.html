<p>I arrived in Huaraz at 6am this morning, and I discovered once again that in this part of the world, things change very quickly. Some places move. Other places close down. <a href="/blog/lonely-planet-you-disappoint-me">Out-of-date Lonely Planet guides</a> can't keep pace. And at the break of dawn, after spending the whole night on a bumpy bus, it's all just a bit too much to handle. Welcome to Huaraz &mdash; can I sleep now?</p>
<p>First of all, since my <abbr title="Lonely Planet">LP</abbr> guide was written, the <em>Movil Tours</em> bus terminal has moved. Used to be near the centre of town, now it's miles away. When I arrived and got off the bus, I started walking towards where I assumed the central Plaza was, based on where I assumed I'd arrived at within the city. Anyway, all these assumptions were wrong. I soon worked out that I wasn't where I thought I was, and that I wasn't going where I thought I was going. Had to resort to a taxi to get me back on track.</p>
<p>Second, I arrived near the city centre; and it turns out that <em>Casa de Guias</em> &mdash; which is listed in my LP as having dormitory accommodation &mdash; no longer has any rooms. Hasn't had any for years, in fact. So I was forced to accept lodging elsewhere, for the morning, at a very crappy place across the mall from <em>Casa de Guias</em>. Thankfully, I found <a href="/blog/jos-place-huaraz">a much better place</a> to stay, a bit later in the morning; and I got out of the crappy place, only having to pay half-price for a day's board there. But it would have been easier if I'd just known about the changes in the first place.</p>
<p>So that was my morning of surprise and confusion, as my welcome to the city of Huaraz. Nothing is forever around here.</p>
