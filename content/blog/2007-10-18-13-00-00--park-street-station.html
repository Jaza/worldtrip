<p>No matter where we go for the day, it seems that every single afternoon here in Boston, my <a href="/blog/dad">dad</a> and I inevitably end up standing on the same platform in Park Street station, waiting for a train back to Newton Center where <a href="/blog/tara-and-ashki">we're staying</a>. I can't help but feel really, really sick of this station! The fact that it's underground, ugly, and badly overheated doesn't help either. Every afternoon, we stand and wait for a train on the same Green C line, looking at the same flamboyant posters advertising iPods, hearing the same drone of pre-recorded announcements. I didn't come to Boston to become intimately familiar with Park Street station. I came to see my family.</p>

<p>It's almost as bad as <em>actually being home</em> (heaven forbid :P), and spending every afternoon standing in Sydney's dreaded Town Hall station (platform 3, Hornsby via North Shore line &mdash; stand clear, doors closing). Uggghhh &mdash; the memories. But hey, what can you do: this is a city in America. Not much different to a city in Australia. Unfortunately, the cities in Europe will probably be much the same. Peak hour rushes. Suits and ties (with people inside &mdash; somewhere) shuffling off to work. Schedules, delays, ticket machines. The paraphernalia of urban "life", and of the joys of mass urban transit.</p>
<p>Anyway, maybe being stuck in a train station in peak-hour for a week is doing me good: it's reminding me of how much ye 'ol 9-5 Mon-Fri routine utterly <em>sucks</em>, and of how lucky I am to have a year away from it all.</p>
