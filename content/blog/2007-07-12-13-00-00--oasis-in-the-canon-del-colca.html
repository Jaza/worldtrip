<p>When we finished our <a href="/blog/hiking-inside-the-canon-del-colca">hiking for the day</a> &mdash; this being our second day in the Cañon del Colca &mdash; we arrived at a little tourist retreat at the bottom of the canyon, called "the oasis". The place claims to have "hot thermal baths": but sadly, it doesn't quite live up to this claim; the palm-encircled pools in this place aren't much more than a chilly 23&deg;C or so. However, it's still a beautiful place, and a great location for relaxing and getting some serenity before hiking like mad, back out of the canyon.</p>

<p>We made it to the oasis at about 2pm this afternoon. When we got there, most of us jumped in the pool, hoping for a hot and soothing dip; the dip wasn't terribly hot, but it was refreshing nonetheless. We found ourselves some beds in one of the <em>hospedajes</em> (guest lodges) down there; and then it was another chilled-out afternoon of reading, sleeping, and eating, before we tucked into bed nice and early, in preparation for tomorrow's early-morning hike out of the canyon.</p>
