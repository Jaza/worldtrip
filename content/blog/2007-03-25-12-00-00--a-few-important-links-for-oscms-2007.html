<p>Well, <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">OSCMS 2007</a> has now finished, and it was an absolute blast. PHP kicked ass, Drupal kicked ass, and Open Source in general (and its grand plans for world domination... bwahahaha) kicked ass. In case any of you have missed these, here is: a link to my slides from <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/node/275">my presentation on site structuring and navigation in Drupal</a>; as well as links to some collections of resources from the summit.</p>
<p>The links:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.greenash.net.au/posts/thoughts/oscms-summit-2007-my-first-drupalcon">My slides from my presentation on site structuring and navigation in Drupal</a></strong>.<br />
All of the <a href="http://www.greenash.net.au/posts/thoughts/topics/drupal">posts on GreenAsh tagged under 'Drupal'</a> are fed into <a href="http://drupal.org/planet">Planet Drupal</a>, so those of you that really wanted to see these, you should have found them already. But in case you didn't, well, now you have. :P</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/oscms2007">All Flickr photos tagged with 'oscms2007'</a></strong>.<br />
Since the vast majority of Drupal people use <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> (including myself), and since 'oscms2007' is the official Flickr tag for the conference, this should show you pretty much all the photos that everyone took at the whole event.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://drupal.org/planet">Planet Drupal</a></strong>.<br />
Everyone's favourite <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> aggregator, which collects all blog posts, by all Drupal people, about everything Drupal. The majority of blog posts about the conference, by everyone who attended, should be available here.</li>
