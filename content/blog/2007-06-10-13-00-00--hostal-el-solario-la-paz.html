<p>Good budget deal in the middle of La Paz, pretty close to all the action. The traffic is a bit noisy and can wake you up in the morning (the traffic is horrible in central La Paz) &mdash; and they have a strange habit of cleaning the bathrooms at 8am in the morning &mdash; but otherwise, no complaints. Not the most social place I've ever stayed at, but certainly better than Tambo de Oro, where I was last night (doesn't merit a write-up, as it's not worth going to at all). If you want the real party scene, then of course you have to stay at <a href="/blog/loki-hostel-la-paz">Loki</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> clean and private, but noisy with traffic in the mornings.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> a lot of Europeans, and a few Israelis &mdash; nice crowd, but not that talkative.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> brisk, not that friendly, but they do their job.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> central of La Paz &mdash; strangely, it's completely surrounded by hairdressers (watch out when you walk down the street &mdash; they'll hassle you for a trim!).</p>
<p><strong>Food / internet:</strong> no food (but there's a kitchen), Internet available for Bs. 4 per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> not 100% reliable, but great most of the time. Watch out for electric shocks &mdash; always wear rubber sandals in the showers (as with many places in South America).</p>
