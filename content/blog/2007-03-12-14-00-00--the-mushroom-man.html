<p>Finding the mushroom man in Palenque isn't very hard. All you have to do is walk down the road for a bit &mdash; from <em>El Panch√°n</em> to the ruins &mdash; and he pops out of the jungle when he sees you. It's a hilarious setup: he's obviously keeping out of sight of the police &mdash; because he's selling illegal hallucinogenic mushrooms &mdash; but he's also obviously got some sort of "arrangement", because he's always there, and he's only really making a token effort to keep hidden.</p>
<p>I ran into the mushroom man a few times, when I was walking to the mystic waterfalls and back. He's a really nice guy, very friendly &mdash; about as far removed as you can get from the stereotypical, violent, threatening, hardened Western drug dealer. It's quite surreal, to just stop and have a pleasant roadside chat with someone in that line of business. He acts more like what he really is: a greengrocer.</p>
