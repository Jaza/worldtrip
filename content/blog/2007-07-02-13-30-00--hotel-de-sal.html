<p>Very awesome place: a hotel on the edge of the Salar de Uyuni, built almost entirely out of salt! For the first night of <a href="/blog/salty-morning">our salt flats tour</a>, we stayed in this ingenious and quite luxurious place. Impressive building, great rooms, and nice food.

<p><em>Little town that the Hotel de Sal is in.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> very stylish, and reasonably warm (considering the temperature outside, at night).</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> well, it's the people that do the salt flat tours &mdash; i.e. any and every <em>gringo</em> in Bolivia!</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> mix of not-to-be-seen-much locals dashing round in the kitchen, and the tourguides, who help out as well.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> well, considering that it's in the middle of nowhere, on the edge of a salt flat, I can't exactly say it's "central" &mdash; but it's a pretty cool spot.</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> dinner and breakfast is very nice. Internet: hahahahahaha! Nearest Internet is about 100km's away.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> I didn't try them; but apparently for Bs. 5 (5 min max), the showers aren't bad (and no, the bathrooms aren't made out of salt, so don't worry about your shower wall disintegrating!).</p>
