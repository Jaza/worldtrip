<p>On Monday night, I <a href="/blog/hampy-web-site-work-begins">started working</a> on a completely new, completely better web web site for <a href="http://hampy.org/">Hampy</a>, a volunteer organisation that I <a href="/blog/chocco-and-hampy-tour">kind of ran into</a> here in Cusco. Between Monday and today, I've spent about 5 hours each night working on the site, over at <a href="/blog/jorge-from-hampy">Jorge</a>'s house (<abbr title="Also Known As">AKA</abbr> "Hampy <abbr title="Headquarters">HQ</abbr>), where I have access to his computer and Internet. And already, the new site is looking pretty good. Design basically done, rough navigation structure done, and a bit of the interactivity done.</p>

<p>Despite having been a bit sick this week (on-and-off since <a href="/blog/the-buffet-that-rose-again">Saturday's buffet lunch</a>), I managed to work a fair bit. However, it looks like I'm still going to need a fair bit more time to get it completely finished. I originally planned to leave Cusco straight after my 3-day rafting trip (which I hope to embark upon this Sunday). But I'm pretty much definitely going on a trip to the jungle, with some Hampy people, the week after that. So I guess I'll be working on the site during all my spare time around and in-between those trips.</p>
