<p>Got back to Huaraz this evening, from my <a href="/blog/santa-cruz-llanganuco-hike-the-wrapup">5-day Santa Cruz-Llanganuco hike</a>, to discover that <a href="/blog/jos-place-huaraz">Jo's Place</a> is full. I'd asked them to reserve me a bad for tonight, when I left on Wednesday: but they said that they couldn't make any guarantees, as they were already booked in advance for <em>28 de Julio</em> (Peru Independence Day) weekend. Anyway, I begged the very-hospitable Mrs. Jo to find me somewhere &mdash; anywhere! &mdash; to crash for the night; and she let me sleep in the <em>cantina</em> (the breakfast kitchen / dining room). I didn't care where I slept tonight; I just cared that I slept. Which I did. Soundly.</p>

<p>Got back to Huaraz this evening, from my <a href="/blog/santa-cruz-llanganuco-hike-the-wrapup">5-day Santa Cruz-Llanganuco hike</a>, to discover that <a href="/blog/jos-place-huaraz">Jo's Place</a> is full. I'd asked them to reserve me a bad for tonight, when I left on Wednesday: but they said that they couldn't make any guarantees, as they were already booked in advance for <em>28 de Julio</em> (Peru Independence Day) weekend. Anyway, I begged the very-hospitable Mrs. Jo to find me somewhere &mdash; anywhere! &mdash; to crash for the night; and she let me sleep in the <em>cantina</em> (the breakfast kitchen / dining room). I didn't care where I slept tonight; I just cared that I slept. Which I did. Soundly.</p>
<p>For the bargain basement price of s/5 (the camping price &mdash; and the lawn was chockers with tents tonight as well), sleeping in the <em>cantina</em> wasn't too bad. Mrs. Jo put down a mattress for me; and with my sleeping bag and all, it was quite warm and quity comfy. I had plenty of space for re-packing my bag with all my crap (which I redeemed from Jo's storage room). Only downside was that the sun woke me up by about 6:30am, and that I had to be out by 7:30am, to make way for people having breakfast. But that was fine, as I was used to getting woken up by the sun, and to rising and shining at that time anyway, after my week in the mountains.</p>
<p>Before I crashed for the night, I went back to the office of Sechin tours, to return all my hired gear. They sold me two little gas bottles (for the cooker), but I only used one of them: managed to sell the spare one back to them. Also told them about the tent having no pegs: didn't seem to bother them too much. They probably knew that when they gave it to me: ba$tards.</p>
<p>Also went for a massive post-hike dinner, as is customary when completing a big adventure in Peru. Found myself a nice <em>polleria</em> in town (not very hard to find &mdash; as with everywhere in Peru, there's no shortage of them!), and ordered myself a mammoth &frac12; a BBQ chicken, plus a mountain of hot chips and salad. Perfect way to finish off a week of intense walking, and of living off under-cooked pasta and rice out of a little plastic bowl. After that, I was more than ready for bed.</p>
