<p>In between our Uxmal day tour, and the Uxmal evening light show, the <a href="/blog/uxmal-road-trip">Uxmal road trippers</a> went to a <em>corrida</em> in Santa Elena. A <em>corrida</em> is a kind of rodeo / country fair affair. We got some seats on the top level of some rickety stadium-ring stands, and watched a gang of Mexican cowboys and matadors have fun with a bull. Check out the video.</p>

<p>They don't fight or kill (or ride) the bull at a <em>corrida</em>; they just play cat-and-mouse with it, and then they ensnare it by flinging ropes at it. Lots of fun to watch, especially amidst a whole arena of cheering Mexican locals.</p>
<p>This was a good, fun local deal, and a great taste of the real country bumpkin Mexico. Mexicans don't like to admit it, but when they're having a good time, they often look a lot like their gringo pals up north.</p>
