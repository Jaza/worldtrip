<p>One of about three very nice, and very good value, lodgings in the tiny village of Chugchilán, on the Quilotoa Loop. The Cloud Forest Hostel is a place with a lot of character, with a lot of warmth, and with very nice rooms and facilities. The large amount of food that they give you is great &mdash; and it's also necessary, since there's virtually nowhere to go and eat in the village. I stayed here two nights, and I was very pleased that it was time well spent.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> quite warm, and extremely comfortable.
</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> friendly bunch of hikers and backpackers, as well as the odd tour group.
</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> the shining example of true country village hospitality.
</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> On the edge of the village &mdash; which is all of one street.
</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> breakfast and dinner are included with your stay, 7 days a week. Both are good, in terms of taste and quantity. No Internet (not sure if there's any in the village?).
</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> considering the size of the village, the showers are amazingly good and reliable.</p>
