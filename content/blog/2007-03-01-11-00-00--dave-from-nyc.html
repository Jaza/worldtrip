<p>In many ways, Dave's the classical New Yorker: hyperactive, procrastinating, loud, and (half) Jewish; but he's also a totally unique guy. He's crazy. About girls. And just in general. I met Dave on my last day in Mérida, and we ended up hanging out together for a fair while, in Valladolid, and then in Playa Del Carmen.</p>
