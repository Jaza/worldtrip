<p>Just finished reading <em>El Principito</em>, and it's the <a href="/blog/primeros-libros-en-espanol">first book that I've read in Spanish</a>! Only took about 2 months &mdash; and it's a children's book, of about 130 (small) pages (some of which are illustrations) &mdash; but I persisted, and I got through it in the end. Obviously, I had the 'ol dictionary by my side the entire time, and I used it prolifically. After having read the book, I feel a lot more confident in my Spanish grammar, and my vocabulary has increased a fair bit. But I think it's time for a break from Spanish books: <em>El Principito</em> was very hard work; now I need a few nice, rubbishy, no-thinking-required, English-language paperbacks to breeze through.</p>

<p>Spending a few days in the laid-back poolside area of <a href="/blog/casa-de-arena-huacachina">Casa de Arena</a>, here in Huacachina, has been the perfect opportunity to catch up on some reading, which I haven't had much time to do lately &mdash; what with all my <a href="/blog/hampy-site-all-night-marathon-finale">frantic volunteering work</a> back in May, and with my hectic travels through the Bolivia-Chile-Peru <em>gringo</em> trail, during June and most of July. Anyway, now that I've overcome the big obstacle of my first book in Spanish, I can return to English books, and start churning through them paperbacks once again.</p>
