<p>This young couple from Holland were two of the people that tried to come <a href="/blog/the-london-guide-yer-bloody-self-tour">on the tour</a> this morning &mdash; they ended up bailing out, and doing a bus tour instead. They're staying here at <a href="/blog/generator-hostel-london">The Generator</a>, on a short trip from home for a week. Very strange set-up that they have: they're best friends, but strictly not boyfriend and girlfriend; they have a private room here in the hostel, but with two single beds! Anyway, they're very friendly, and wish they could be travelling longer.</p>
