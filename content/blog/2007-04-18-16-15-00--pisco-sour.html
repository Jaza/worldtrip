<p>It's the national drink of Peru. It's bloody strong. And it's bloody nice. I already had plenty of it in Lima, in shot form; but tonight in Aguas Calientes, I had it as a cocktail. Vodka-like spirit, mixed with a kind of lemon juice concoction. Nice and tasty. And, of course, perfect preparation for tomorrow's <a href="/blog/dawn-sprint-up-to-machu-picchu">dawn ascent to Machu Picchu</a>.</p>
