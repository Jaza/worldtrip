<p>After dinner, Steve and I went out for a stroll, in search of some more good Xalapa bars. Apart from La Chiva, which we already visited last night, we couldn't find anywhere else to hang out and have a beer. And this is Friday night, for heaven's sake! Where are all the bars in Xalapa?</p>
<p>Apparently, it was simply a matter of us having looked in the wrong area. We went exploring the area south of La Chiva, while we should have gone a fair way west instead. Ah well, you live and learn.</p>
