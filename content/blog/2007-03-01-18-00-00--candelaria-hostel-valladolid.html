<p>Nice and cheap, but I think that this will be one of the less memorable hostels on my journey. It has the same outdoorish setup as Nomadas in Mérida, but somehow, it doesn't seem as well done. Anyway, it was a good place to crash for two nights.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> basic, not much privacy (window looks out onto town square).</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> great, but <abbr title="Sometimes there, sometimes not">perennial</abbr>.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> some are a bit unfriendly and obnoxious.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> nice 'n' central.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> nice fine breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> none (great café across the road, though).</p>
