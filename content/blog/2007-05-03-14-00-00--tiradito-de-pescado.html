<p>After the success of <a href="/blog/lomo-saltado">making lomo saltado</a> in last Thursday's cooking class, I decided to come back for more this week. <em>Tiradito de pescado</em> is a delicious dish of raw fish, served cold with a chili and lemon paste sauce, and with sweet potato and corn. This week, not only did we have this gourmet cuisine to prepare; we also had a professional chef instructing us, a bigger kitchen to work with (<a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a>'s kitchen), and a bigger class. <em>¡Perfecto y muy Rico!</em></p>
