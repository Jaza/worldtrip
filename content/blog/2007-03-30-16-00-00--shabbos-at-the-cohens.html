<p>Tonight was my first family Shabbos dinner since leaving home, almost six weeks ago. I have to say, it's more than nice to do this once in a while: it's actually very important. All the Cohens were home for Erev Shabbat, except for Andy, who was orchestrating an inter-school dance that happened at his school this evening. Beautiful dinner, beautiful atmosphere.</p>

<p>Hi Jeremy,<br />
I'm a first time blogger. Its hard to believe that you are going to more formal synagogues than the ultra orthodox. I was very impressed that you're riding a trek in one of the photos. I am looking after its cousin in Australia. Its riding beautifully down the hills of Roseville, Lidfield and Killara. Have a great Pesach and hope that you get to have another Pesach feed at another friends place. Is there a mathematical theory regarding  the probability of having dinners out. Michael</p>

<p>The next morning, we also went to synagogue for the (tail end of the) Saturday morning service, followed by a kick-ass catered lunch. We didn't go to the Cohens' shule, because it was for a bamitzvah (a friend of theirs). They go to a conservative shule nearby, but this was a reform shule, closer to central Vancouver. The way shules work here in Vancouver seems pretty similar to the way they work in Sydney, except that it's perhaps a little more formal than what I'm used to.</p>
<p>All up, a great Canadian Shabbat experience.</p>
