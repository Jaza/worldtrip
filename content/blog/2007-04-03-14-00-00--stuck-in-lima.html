<p>Well, I don't have much to do in Lima, in the way of activities, but it looks like I'm stuck here for the rest of the week, for several reasons. First and foremost, this week is <em>Semana Santa</em> (lit: "Holy Week" &mdash; a.k.a. Easter), so it would be both difficult and expensive to get out of Lima, and to find somewhere to stay once I got out. Second, it's also Pesach this week, and it's much easier to observe this festival by staying in one spot and sitting on your backside, than it is by being on the road. And third, I'd like to see my friend <a href="/blog/antonio-ognio">Antonio Ognio</a> before I leave, and to spend at least one day with him.</p>

<p>So, for all these reasons, it looks like it's going to be a more-or-less quiet week to kick off (no pun intended!) South America, spent here at the <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a>, and living frugally on my simple, bread-free groceries.</p>
