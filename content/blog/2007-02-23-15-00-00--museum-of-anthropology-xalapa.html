<p><em>The very long main corridor of the museum.</em></p>
<p>One of the things that I really liked about this museum was that it's local. Everything in it is local. It concentrates on the Olmec &mdash; and, to a lesser extent, Toltec &mdash; civilisations that flourished in the Xalapa region, prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>The museum is most famous for its Olmec <em>cabezas gigantes</em> (lit: "gigantic heads"), of which it has several; with each one consisting of at least 3 cubic metres of solid rock.</p>

<p>I guess that if I was a human sacrifice 1,100 years ago, my philosophy would have been that if I was going to be sacrificed, I'd at least want to be sacrificed to something <em>big</em>. And these fellas really are big.</p>
<p>There are countless statues, cooking utensils, rock shards, and other works of stone in the museum. The majority of them are extremely well-preserved. There's even a circular rock carving &mdash; a single, unified circle of rock tapestry &mdash; that goes round for about 30m in length.</p>
<p>There's also a large tabletop model of the site of El Tajin, the ruins that are about 4 hours north of Xalapa, that I unfortunately won't be able to see on this trip (they're too far out of my way, and they're not in the "must-see" class of ruins). The model conveys the size, the grandeur, and the good condition of El Tajin quite vividly.</p>
