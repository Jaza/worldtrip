<p>Just as we were leaving our campsite from the 1st night of the <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">Salkantay hike</a>, we saw a big building under rapid construction. A building that looked very much like it could be a hostel. And judging by its progress, I think it will be ready in just a few months' time. Are we one of the last groups that will get to do this hike as it's meant to be done, with camping? If so, then I count myself very lucky, and I feel sorry for the people ahead of me, who won't get the same experience that I enjoyed.</p>
