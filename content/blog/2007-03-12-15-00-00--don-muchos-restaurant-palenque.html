<p>During my two-and-a-bit days in <em>El Panchán</em>, I ate every breakfast and every dinner at <em>Don Muchos</em>. Considering that it's really the only place to eat at <em>El Panchán</em>, this should come as no surprise. Also, considering that they have a total monopoly over everyone who's staying in <em>El Panchán</em> (and who can't be bothered to go into town for food), they're quite reasonably priced.</p>

<p>During my two-and-a-bit days in <em>El Panchán</em>, I ate every breakfast and every dinner at <em>Don Muchos</em>.

<p><em>Don Muchos</em> do a few good little "packages" for breakfast, such as <em>huevos rancheros</em> (Mexican eggs), and granola cereal. Their dinner menu is of a wide variety, and is generally quite well-priced. Plus, they also have a well-stocked bar of an evening, and an eclectic variety of live music.</p>
<p>Oh, and they have fire jugglers at night, too.</p>
