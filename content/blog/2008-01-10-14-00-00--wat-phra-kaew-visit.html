<p>Today was a momentous day in the history of my life. First proper day in Thailand. First proper day in <em>all of Asia.</em> First proper sightseeing in Thailand or in Asia. And first ever visit to a Buddhist temple. A momentous day: but in my sweltering and jet-lagged state, not an overly strenuous one. To kick off my exploration of the sights and sounds of Bangkok, I went and saw Wat Phra Kaew, one of the largest and most magnificent of the city's many <em>wats</em> (lit: "temples"). Lovely temple &mdash; and boy, never before have I seen so much, covered in such quantities of pure gold, in all my life. Buddha like his gold nice 'n' shiny.</p>

<p>Wat Phra Kaew is a nice, convenient 10-minute walk from <a href="/blog/khao-san-road">Khao San Road</a> (which is the area I'm staying in, of course). The journey to the temple was a trip down memory lane for me, as it retraced my steps from where <a href="/blog/lost-in-bangkok">I got lost</a> yesterday evening. Since I rocked up at the temple wearing my disrespectfully knee-length boardies, I was obliged to shell out 50B at the door, so that I could hire a pair of flamboyant, baggy long pants. Worth the cost, in my opinion: better than walking all the way there in long pants; and other than that, there's no entry fee to visit the temple.

<p>The <em>wat</em> is a captivating structure: it's painted everywhere in a lovely set of vivid pastel colours; its curves and spires are exotic and gracious; and pure gold can be seen in lavish abundance on it. I realise that there are literally thousands of other temples &mdash; and that's just here in Thailand &mdash; and that they're all built in a similar style. But because this is the first authentic Asian temple I've ever seen, the architecture really did blow me away: I was awed by its new, exotic and regal style.

<p>After wandering around the temple gardens for a bit, and admiring the fabulous architecture, I respectfully removed my shoes and entered the main meditation hall. The front of this hall is a cordoned-off area filled with gold Buddhas and other sacred statues; while the communal area at the rear is filled mainly with awkward-looking <em>farangs</em>, and also with a few Thai locals (and even the odd monk or two). I followed the example of my <em>farang</em> brethren, and haphazardly sat down cross-legged on the stone floor. Sitting down was quite uncomfortable &mdash; especially since you're meant to point your toes backwards, as doing otherwise is considered disrespectful to the Buddha &mdash; and I must say, I made very little headway in achieving inner peace here. The babbling tour guide sitting next to me didn't help with that, either: although eavesdropping on his lecture did provide plenty of useful information.
</p>
<p>After I was done at the temple, I exited the compound and returned to the main street &mdash; only to find the road closed off to vehicles, smartly-dressed policemen directing people onto the sidewalks, and a dense crowd of spectators lining the road on both sides. Apparently, the King's brother died today: the spectating crowds and the road closures were in anticipation of a big procession; and due to the unfortunate death in the family, I hear that the Royal Palace is closed to visitors for most of the day. Anyway, I didn't see a procession or anything like that when I hit the streets: just a lot of people waiting for one to start.
</p>
<p>From the temple, I headed over towards the river, where I found a shaded little food market, whose stalls offered a variety of hot meals for lunch. I randomly picked one of the stalls: and since they clearly only served one dish, I asked them for whatever it was that they had available. I have very little idea what it was that I ate &mdash; some kind of mystery soup, with vegetables and balls of possibly seafood &mdash; but it tasted pretty good. I sat down and finished off the soup with a visiting young Hungarian couple, who also agreed that the soup was delicious, but an enigma.</p>
