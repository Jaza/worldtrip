<p>Along with <a href="/blog/the-smoking-finns">the smoking Finns</a>, two other great people that I met this evening at <a href="/blog/kabul-hostel-barcelona">Kabul</a> were the Chilean boys down in the bar. These guys &mdash; from Santiago, of course &mdash; are here in Europe for a quick holiday, before heading back home to their work and their studies. I haven't met all that many South American fellow travellers here in Europe, and it was a pleasant surprise to find these guys here. Sadly, being from Chile and all, they speak <a href="/blog/chile-quick-northern-wrapup">Español Chileno</a> &mdash; which is officially the world's worst dialect of Spanish, and which I understand about as well as Mongolian.</p>
