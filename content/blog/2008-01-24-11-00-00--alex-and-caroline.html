<p><em>Alex, Caroline and myself (left to right) chill out this evening in Ko Tao.</em></p>
<p>Caroline's story is a bit sad: she split up with her boyfriend (after three years together) one week ago; and they'd planned on doing this whole trip together. Since they'd already bought the tickets and everything, they ended up flying to Thailand together: but since Bangkok, they've gone their separate ways. So she's a bit lost right now, and she's just trying to make the most of a very strange and awkward situation. Alex's situation is much brighter: after Thailand, he's flying over to Sydney (a week before I do); and he's going to be at Sydney Uni this year for 6 months, while he studies on exchange! The two of us will be down the road from each other for an entire semester &mdash; so I'm sure we'll be seeing plenty of each other over the next year.</p>
