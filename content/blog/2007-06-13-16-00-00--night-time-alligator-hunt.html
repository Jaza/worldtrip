<p>Following our <a href="/blog/sunset-bar-we-serve-cold-beer">trip to the Sunset Bar</a>, and a formidable spread for dinner, our group got back in the motorised canoe this evening, and cruised through the darkness of the <em>pampas</em>, looking for alligator eyes. It was a very unique and bizarre experience: on the water in the dark of night, with our flashlights searching the shores of the river, looking for pairs of orange eyes reflecting back at us. We spotted quite a lot of the alligators and their highly luminescent eyes; but unfortunately, our guide didn't manage to catch one and bring it on board. Damn: I was so looking forward to having another passenger on board &mdash; one with a two-foot-long mouth full of chomping teeth.</p>

<p>Luckily, although it was a very hot night, there weren't too many mosquitoes out in the dark. However, there was a spectacular abundance of stars in the <em>pampas</em> sky overhead; almost as many as on a good, clear night in the highlands. The alligator hunting was good fun, but it was also a bit weird; and I wasn't feeling 100% (change of altitude and the heat / humidity getting to me), so I couldn't really enjoy it fully.</p>
