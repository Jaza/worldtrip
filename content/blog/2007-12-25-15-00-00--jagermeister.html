<p><a href="http://www.jager.com/">Jägermeister</a> is a strong German liqueur, that for some reason has become wildly popular all over the Western world today. It tastes pretty bad (it was originally invented for medicinal use), but makes up for it with its legendary effect. I haven't gone near any Jäger for most of my trip: but here in Kitzbühel, everyone seems to be drinking an awful lot of the stuff &mdash; especially in the form of "Flying Hirsch" or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A4gerbomb">Jägerbomb</a>" shots (i.e. Jäger and <a href="http://www.redbull.com/">Red Bull</a> together). It sure as hell ain't Aussie &mdash; and it's not Austrian either (although Red Bull is) &mdash; but <a href="/blog/craig-sarah-and-kade">Aussies in Austria</a> can't get enough of it. Personally, I can take Jäger or I can leave it; and I don't see what all the fuss is about.</p>
