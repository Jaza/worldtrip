<p>We <a href="/blog/romp-in-the-madidi-jungle">romped through the jungle on our first day</a> here <a href="/blog/rurrenabaque-jungle-trip-begins">in Madidi</a>. We did it again yesterday. And we had our final romp today. Not much different to the previous days of jungle walking, really: saw a few animals, saw lots of trees and smaller plants, but nothing hugely exciting. After all, jungle is jungle, and there's only so much of it you can see.</p>
