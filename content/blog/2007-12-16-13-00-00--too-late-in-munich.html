<p>I'm officially labelling today "the day that I just missed everything". First there was <a href="/blog/train-to-munich">the train from Dresden</a> that I missed by 2 minutes. Then, this evening, I wandered down to Munich's Christmas market, to grab a bratwurst for dinner &mdash; arriving in the square at 7:30pm &mdash; only to find all the stalls shutting in my face as I got there! Apparently, the market closes at 7:30pm <em>sharp</em> on Sunday evenings. Next, I went for the next-best (and next-cheapest) option, and found a kebab shop at which to grab some tucker. Too late: they'd already stopped serving for the evening; luckily I found another one around the corner, that obliged me with a meaty plate of doner and salad. Finally, I jumped online at a nearby café; and they decided to close &frac12; an hour earlier than advertised ("family crisis" with the owners), and to kick me out prematurely. It definitely hasn't been my lucky day!</p>

<p>The train I can understand. The Internet I can understand. But the food? What bizarre logic was going through the minds of the Christmas market organisers, when they decided that they'd shut at 7:30pm on Sunday evenings &mdash; exactly the time when everyone's looking for some dinner? And when I got to the market, there were actually a lot of people in the same boat as me, looking for a bite and perplexed that there was none available. Same with the (first) kebab place: if you want to stay in business, then you gotta be open when people are hungry.</p>
<p>I think I'm still struggling to adjust to the whole German "punctuality and earliness" thing. As with the German "<a href="/blog/how-did-the-german-cross-the-road">respect for small rules</a>" thing, it's quite alien to what I've become accustomed with, while travelling in the Latin world. Here in Germany, things start early and they finish early; and they start not a minute before the time advertised, and close up shop not a minute after. Their retail mindset is the same as their train-catching mindset. If you arrive at one hot dog shop at 7:31pm, and it's closed, then you've got 14 minutes to get to the other hot dog shop that closes at 7:45pm. I think that what one fellow traveller told me a few days ago is spot-on: the <a href="http://www.bahn.de/international/view/en/index.shtml">Deutsche Bahn</a> does indeed run the entire country &mdash; in mind, body and soul.</p>
