<p>Ever since I arrived in South America, it's been gnawing at me.

<p>It's out-of-date (it's the 2004 edition &mdash; the 2007 edition only came out in March), it's lacking in detail (everything from the "proper" individual-country <abbr title="Lonely Planet">LP</abbr> guides has been chopped in half), and half the time it's just plain wrong. Pull your socks up, LP: you have the reputation, but you fail to deliver!</p>

<p>Ever since I arrived in South America, it's been gnawing at me. Now, finally, I can't hold it in any longer: my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-South-America-Shoestring/dp/174104443X">Lonely Planet South America on a Shoestring</a> guide really does leave a lot to be desired. As <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">Agent Smith from <em>The Matrix</em></a> would say:</p>

<p>It's out-of-date (it's the 2004 edition &mdash; the 2007 edition only came out in March), it's lacking in detail (everything from the "proper" individual-country <abbr title="Lonely Planet">LP</abbr> guides has been chopped in half), and half the time it's just plain wrong. Pull your socks up, LP: you have the reputation, but you fail to deliver!</p>
<p>The thing that really disappoints with my book, more than anything else, is the accommodation listings. If they were just out-of-date, I might be able to forgive them. But it's worse than that. Really, really popular hostels, such as <a href="/blog/loki-hostel-cusco">Loki Cusco</a>, and The Point in Arequipa, have been around for more than three years; but they're not listed. Finding a good place to stay is crucial, especially when you're backpacking by yourself: you gotta go where you're gonna meet other, like-minded people. Right now, LP ain't helping much with that. At the moment, I'm having to resort to researching on the Internet, before I reach the next town, as to where's a popular and comfortable place to stay.</p>
<p>Same with the city maps in my book. It's not (just) that they're out-of-date: it's that the LP folks decided to only cover a certain area of each town; and that anywhere outside that arbitrary little rectangle, is not covered at all. Place to stay, place to eat, place to get transport, place to party, a little bit on the edge of town? Too bad &mdash; you'll just have to find it yourself, because LP couldn't be ar$ed mapping it for you.</p>
<p>The worst thing is, about 90% of the backpackers down here at the moment, are stuck with this useless, better-as-toilet-paper, 2004 edition of the Shoestring Guide. And we all despise it.</p>
<p>What's more, we've seen the "Lonely Planet: Peru" guide, and the "Lonely Planet: Bolivia" guide &mdash; and after having seen them, we understand that we are second-rate citizens. Why must you make your continent-wide Shoestring Guide so inferior, LP? Why do we have half the listings, half the explanations, and half the tips? And why do you release new editions of your country-specific guides constantly, but wait for years on end before updating the so-popular-yet-so-overrated continent-wide Shoestring Guide?</p>
<p>There's competition out there, LP. There's <a href="http://www.roughguides.com/">Rough Guides</a>. There's <a href="http://www.footprintguides.com/">Footprint</a>. There's <a href="http://www.insightguides.com/">Insight</a>. If you don't get your act together, we will take you down. Your reputation is only as good as your books. So clean 'em up!</p>
