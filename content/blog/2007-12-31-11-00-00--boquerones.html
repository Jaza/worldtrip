<p>For my second-ever taste of <em>tapas</em> (after yesterday's <a href="/blog/patatas-bravas"><em>patatas bravas</em></a>), today I tried a little dish called <em>boquerones en vinagre</em> (lit: "anchovies in vinegar"). Very tasty: a plateful of the teeny fish are soaked in vinegar juice, and served to you fresh and cold. Spain is well-known for its good seafood, and I was quite impressed by this little introduction to the world thereof. More fish awaits!</p>
