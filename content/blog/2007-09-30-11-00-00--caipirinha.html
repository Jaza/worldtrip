<p>If you went to Brazil and you didn't have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha"><em>caipirinha</em></a>, you must have been living in a cave. It's the national cocktail of Brazil: and like most things in this country, it's sweet, lethally strong, and divine &mdash; all at the same time. Made with lime, sugar, and <em>cachaça</em> (fermented sugarcane), the <em>caipirinha</em> tastes a bit like the lime cocktails you can find up in the Caribbean, such as Mexico's <em>margarita</em>, or Cuba's <em>mojito</em>. Only it's better.</p>
