<p>From the <a href="/blog/bad-vibes-in-roccapalumba">town of Roccapalumba</a>, this afternoon I kept cycling through the highlands for as long as I could, until it was getting dark and I simply had to camp somewhere. I managed to make it just short of the town of Lercara, where I found a field that was between several properties (houses, workshops, and such), and that didn't seem to be claimed or used by any of its neighbours. I guess it was vacant &mdash; anyway, the neighbours saw me camped there, and they didn't try to kick me off, or to hassle me in any way; so stay there the night is what I did. The field was a little bit close to the highway (traffic noise), and there were leeches crawling around in the grass; but otherwise, it was a good spot to squat for the night; and I had a nice view of the countryside all around, and of the city of Lercara lit up ahead of me.</p>

<p>My final hour or so of cycling for the day was a bit of a navigational challenge, as I had to turn on and off about three different intersecting highways, in order to keep going in the direction I was headed. This, combined with the gathering dark, made the ride a bit stressful. Plus, there was the issue of finding somewhere to camp for the night: seeing that I was amidst highway junctions for a fair while (not the ideal place to camp), and that there were fenced properties on the roadside for most of the way, I was pretty anxious, and getting rather desperate, by the time I found my lucky field. Anyway, it all turned out fine in the end &mdash; I was just a bit silly in leaving it so late.</p>
