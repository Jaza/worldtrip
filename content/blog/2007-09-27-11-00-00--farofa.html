<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farofa"><em>Farofa</em></a> is a simple dish consisting of raw flour from <em>manioc</em> (the root of the <a href="/blog/yuca"><em>yuca</em></a> plant), which is fried and sometimes flavoured. Usually served as an accompaniment to beans and meat, <em>farofa</em> is one of the staple foods, and the hallmark dishes, of Brazilian cuisine. Most <em>gringos</em> can't stand <em>farofa</em> &mdash; on account of it tasting like sawdust, to the uninitiated &mdash; but I'm starting to get used to it, and even to like it. Apparently it's very healthy, and it also keeps you going for quite a while.</p>
