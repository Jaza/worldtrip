<p>I wanted to send a New York postcard to <a href="/blog/staying-with-the-polar-covarrubias-family">my old host family</a> back in Cusco, Peru, before I left for Boston. So this morning, I went to the Central Post Office, near Penn Station in Manhattan, to send off the postcard. Well, it turns out that going to the post office on Columbus Day is a Really Bad Idea&trade;. The Central Post Office was, apparently, the only post office in all of Greater New York that was open today. I walked inside, and there was <em>one</em> service desk open (with the other 25 or so roller-doored shut), and <em>nobody</em> at the information booth, and a queue that was literally about <em>100 feet long</em> (that's over 30 metres!). And all I wanted to do was buy a stamp. Stuff that &mdash; I'm not waiting 3 hours to buy a daym stamp &mdash; I'll send the bloody thing in Boston.</p>
