<p>If you happen to be in Arequipa, and you need to find yourself a new digital camera, then jump in a taxi, and ask them to take you to "Mercado Avelino". Although some of the vendors in this place look a bit suss, most of them seem to be reputable enough: the cameras aren't ridiculously underpriced, and by and large, they seem to be new and undamaged. Got mine for USD$250 ($280 with 2GB memory card + reader, and camera case) &mdash; battery, charger, USB cable, and instruction manuals included &mdash; and it's selling in the boutiques in the centre of town for $350. And as far as I can tell, it's never been owned before, and it's taking me some great pics. I'm one satisfied customer: and I'm once again a traveller who has his most important possession!</p>
