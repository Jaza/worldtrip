<p>Well, old chaps, I'm going to commence my British Blogging in a decidedly, well, English way: by moaning about the weather. It seems that every person I've ever met in my life, who's been to England, was 100% right: the weather really is <strong>s$%#</strong> here. And no, that garbled 4-letter sequence does <em>not</em> translate to "spantabulous"; guess again. Today's weather in London is about as English as any weather I could imagine: cold, overcast, drizzly, and unbelievably gloomy. I guess that's why the Chili Peppers sing about <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/red+hot+chili+peppers/emit+remmus_20114737.html">London in the summer time</a>; because now that it's Autumn, there's nothing to sing about at all. Nevertheless, it's still good to be here.</p>

<p>Well, old chaps, I'm going to commence my British Blogging in a decidedly, well, English way: by moaning about the weather.

<p>The lousy weather is one excuse for my not doing much today. My silly <a href="/blog/jetlagged-in-london">morning nap</a> is another. Anyway, despite these hindrances, I did manage to get in a little bit of exploring today, for the first day of my life here in the glorious Mother Country. I walked up to King's Cross Station, one of London's most famous train stations, as well as a very grand old building. I looked round, but I saw no sign whatsoever of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Platform 9&frac34;</a>. I also took a walk up to Regent's Park, which is a serene place to walk through, and also home to London's zoo (which was shut by the time I walked past it). I walked up the hill just north of the park, which would &mdash; on a better day &mdash; command a sweeping view of the city.</p>

<p><em>Today, however, the view was average to say the most.</em></p>
<p>I wandered around the area south of Regent's Park a bit, and managed to stumble upon Baker St. Being a fan of the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, I immediately recognised this street as the (fictional) home of the detective &mdash; and I decided it was worth having a squiz around, to see if Sherlock actually has a (non-fictional) house here these days. And it turns out that he does!</p>
