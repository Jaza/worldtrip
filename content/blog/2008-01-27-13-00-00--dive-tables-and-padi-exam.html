<p>We completed the theory component of our <a href="/blog/padi-diving-course-begins">Open Water course</a> this afternoon, with a final class (held by Lucy, another one of the instructors) teaching us about the use of dive tables. When you go diving, your body absorbs a higher-than-usual amount of nitrogen (depending on depth and time); and dive tables are used to calculate how much nitrogen you've absorbed (approximately), and to help you keep within safe nitrogen level limits. Lots of theory about such things as: pressure groups; nitrogen quantity; minimum surface intervals; and total bottom times. Once the class was done, we'd been taught all the required theory for the course, and so we were ready to undertake the final exam.</p>

<p>The teaching of the theory component of the course may have been <em>something</em> of a joke: but the <abbr title="Professional Association of Diving Instructors">PADI</abbr> final exam was a <em>complete</em> joke. We were told to all complete it downstairs, in the restaurant; we were encouraged to talk to each other, and even to blatantly copy off each other; and at the end of the exam, rather than being passed or failed, we simply signed a statement saying: "any questions that I answered incorrectly have been explained to me, and I now understand them". It was multiple-choice, and I scraped in a solid 47/50.</p>
<p>Using dive tables involves a little bit of maths, but it's pretty simple stuff. Basically, it's just a lot of lookups, and a bit of addition as well. Why, then, did my head hurt so much when I was doing the calculations, and why did I find it all so inexplicably difficult? I guess that since I've done nothing more complex than restaurant maths over the past year, and that since my maths has never been terribly crash-hot, my brain's arithmetic muscles have all but shrivelled up and died. Has a year-long holiday made me braindead? I hope not, because in one month's time I'm going back to university, and beginning an intensive thesis program! Perhaps I should tickle my brain a bit, before I dive back into the studying life. </p>
