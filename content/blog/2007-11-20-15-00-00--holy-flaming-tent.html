<p>While camped in my <a href="/blog/a-field-near-pedagaggi">field near Pedagaggi</a> this evening, I was cooking up some dinner in my tent, when I caused a lightning-quick and most disturbing accident. I turned on my little gas cooker (i.e. opened the gas valve, used a cigarette lighter to ignite it), and a massive flame shot out of it, &frac12; a metre straight up in the air. And this was <em>inside my tent!</em> The flame usually leaps out a little bit when you first ignite it &mdash; but not this much. Needless to say, the flame touched the walls of my tent: and it burnt a hole right through my front tent flap. Fortunately, the hole wasn't too big &mdash; only about 20cm in diameter &mdash; so I was able to patch it up (as an interim measure), with a large tract of trusty 'ol duct tape. The hole is sealed for now, but I'll have to get it fixed properly when I return home next year.</p>

<p>The damage is not what concerns me so much. A 20cm hole in the front flap isn't that bad &mdash; it could have been much worse. What <em>really</em> concerns me is that the tent (the flap part of it, at least) is made of such flammable material, that a flame can touch it for as little as &frac12; a second, and can literally <em>vapourise</em> what it touches in that time. Bearing that in mind, it's lucky the whole daym thing didn't go up in smoke. Maybe it's some kind of fire safety measure: perhaps it's a special material that vapourises instantly, instead of smoldering, or causing fire to otherwise spread or linger. Anyway, I'll have to be more careful with fire and tents in the future &mdash; this is a <a href="/blog/tent-and-accessories">great new tent</a> I've got, and I sure as hell don't wanna lose it to a trigger-happy gas cooker accident.</p>
