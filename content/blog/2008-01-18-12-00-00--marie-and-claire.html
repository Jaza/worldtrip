<p>Marie and Claire are two girls that I met on the <a href="/blog/off-to-pai">bus to Pai</a> this morning, and they're two great examples of encounters that you can't help but feel have something to do with fate. They're also both travelling alone; and like myself, neither of them has any particular plans for what they want to do here in Pai (apart from hanging out and seeing what all the fuss is about). Marie's a real estate agent from England, and Claire's a marketing manager from the USA. I ended up hanging out, riding bikes, and drinking a few nights away with these great ladies &mdash; when I think of Pai, I'll think of them.</p>
