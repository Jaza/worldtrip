<p>The morning's <a href="/blog/tough-slog-to-tindari">ride to Tindari</a> was tough and wet; but in contrast, the rest of the day was easy-going and sunny. From Capo Tindari, I simply continued west for the entire day, along my good friend the SS113 coastal highway. I passed through Capo d'Orlando around midday, but I decided not to ride all the way up to the cape itself: my guidebook doesn't say anything exciting about it; and I've had enough hilly capes for one day. The Sicilian north coast around here continued to be endless, as well as endlessly lovely &mdash; it's still a bit over-developed in this area; although the concentration of towns and resorts got less dense as I continued west.

<p>I grabbed a delicious hot chocolate and a pastry near Capo d'Orlando; and in the town of Sant' Agata, last night's leftovers became today's lunch. After yesterday's excellent <a href="/blog/gelato-in-milazzo">gelato experience</a> in Milazzo, I was kinda holding out for another gelato, in whatever town I happened to pass through this afternoon. Well, that town happened to be the very sleepy village of Caronia: and disappointingly, there was no gelato available there! In fact, there was nothing open <em>at all</em> in Caronia &mdash; couldn't even find a packet of chips, a can of coke, nothing &mdash; which I felt was most unfortunate.

<p>All up, my second day on the road in Sicily was largely calm, relaxed, and easy; albeit a bit uneventful. Anyway, the coast was certainly beautiful &mdash; plus, the easy roads made for excellent progress around the island.</p>
