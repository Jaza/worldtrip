<p>I made acquaintance with these two boys, on today's <a href="/blog/dos-rios-hike">hike to Dos Rios</a>. Both of them are from Italy, and they're old friends: however, one is just in Brazil for a short holiday; and the other one is currently living in São Paulo. When we finished the hike, they invited the lot of us back to their cosy little guesthouse, for a barbeque and some drinks. Great lads: warm to all around them, and always ready to have a good time.</p>
