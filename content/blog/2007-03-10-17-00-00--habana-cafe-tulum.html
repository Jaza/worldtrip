<p>This place is arguably the best nighttime hangout in Tulum, and it's where I went, with various friends, for four nights in a row. Tonight was my final night there, and it was a big one. Live band, intense dancing, and the usual deal of 2-for-1 <em>Cuba Libres</em> until 11pm. The bar is also conveniently located across the road from <em>The Weary Traveler</em>.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, <em>Habana Café</em> is a Cuban bar, and they've made a great effort to give it an authentic look-and-feel. On Wednesday night, they had some live reggae, which really added to the feel of it. They even have some pictures of Fidel Castro and other famous Cubans hanging on the walls.</p>
