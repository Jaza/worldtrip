<p>Very comfortable guesthouse, just outside of the busy part of Rurrenabaque, with a very nice atmosphere, and a great balcony full of lazy hammocks to crash in. Stayed here in between my jungle and <em>pampas</em> trips in the area, and it was nice and cosy every time.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> clean, respectable, and quiet.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> generally too tired and chilled to chat much, but a very nice crowd all-round.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> a bit brisk and business-like, but accommodating enough.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> a few streets away from the main part of Rurrenabaque: much quieter than other places, and still close enough to everything.</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> none.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> reliable and luxurious.</p>
