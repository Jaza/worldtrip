<p>So here I am in New York City, in the beating heart of the USA. And what do I hear in my first hour outside today, walking down the streets of Manhattan? Do I hear "let's go for coffee", "put it in the trunk", or "you want that to go"? Not a chance! Every 5 seconds, it's <em>"qué cabrón es mi primo"</em>, <em>"hasta once y media"</em>, and <em>"estamos tardes, vamos"</em>. What's going on &mdash; have I left Latin America, or what?! I could barely put one foot in front of the other, in this city, without hearing people talking Spanish, seeing shop signs in Spanish, and even giving passers-by directions in Spanish! Seriously: <em>"¿donde están los gringos?"</em> (lit: "where are all the <em>gringos</em>?"). Apparently, Spanish is just as useful back here in the USA, as it is down south of the border &mdash; in some neighbourhoods, perhaps even more useful than English.</p>

<p>So here I am in New York City, in the beating heart of the USA. And what do I hear in my first hour outside today, walking down the streets of Manhattan?

<p>Of course, they're mainly Mexicans, here in the US &mdash; with most of the others being from nearby Central American and Caribbean countries. And a whopping <strong>50%+</strong> of them are here illegally, getting exploited with below-minimum-wage pay, and having no rights and no security whatsoever. There are estimated to be literally millions of them, spread throughout the country, and doing all the s$#% work that nobody else is desperate enough to do. What's more, the government is doing very little about it, and for a very good reason: they've become an essential and much relied-on part of the US economy; and without their virtual slave labour, that already-fragile US economy would spiral even further down the plughole than it is right now. A sad and a complicated situation, but that's how it is around here.</p>
