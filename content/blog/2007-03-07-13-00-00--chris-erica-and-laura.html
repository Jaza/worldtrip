<p><em>Chris, Emily (not Erica), and Laura (left-to-right), on the beach at Tulum.</em></p>
<p>Chris is an interesting guy to be around. Being a web developer, like myself, we have a bit of business to talk about. But mainly, we enjoyed sharing ridiculous British accents with each other. Chris <em>is</em> British, so this gives him some advantage.</p>
<p>Erica is a Swedish girl, and Laura is another Brit. These two got a lift down to Tulum from a(nother) crazy New Yorker named Donald, who tried to make them stay with him at <em>Mar Caribe</em>. Erica enjoyed teaching us a few words of Swedish. Laura added a touch of class with her Oxford upbringing; a touch of beauty with her gorgeous looks; and a touch of olfactory delight with her coconut-scented sunscreen.</p>
