<p>Before I came here to Argentina, I'd honestly never even heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_%28beverage%29"><em>mate</em></a> (pronounced <em>MA-te</em>, with "ma" as in "muster", and "te" as in "test"), let alone been aware that it's the country's most-prided national beverage. But now that I'm here, I've quickly become educated about it; and to visit Argentina without trying the famous drink would be nothing less than sacrilege. So, when I was offered a cupful today, I gladly accepted. It is quite a bitter tea &mdash; but it's not that bad, and I think that <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/">LP</a>'s description of <em>mate</em>-drinking as being akin to "ingesting horse $hit" is a bit harsh. However, I can see that, to put it mildly, <em>mate</em> is an acquired taste.</p>
