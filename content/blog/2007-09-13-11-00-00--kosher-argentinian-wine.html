<p>As I've <a href="/blog/about-the-wine">already mentioned</a> numerous times lately, Argentina has fabulous wine, and it's available here in ridiculously cheap abundance. Today, at the Chabad <a href="/blog/rosh-hashanah-celebrations-day-1">Rosh Hashanah first day lunch</a>, I tried some kosher Argentinian wine for the first time. Sorry, but I can't remember the brand (can't find it online, either). The verdict? About what you'd expect. It was the best kosher wine I've ever had. And the worst Argentinian wine I've ever had.</p>
