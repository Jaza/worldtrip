<p>Mario, my host father here in Cusco, has been in hospital with pneumonia for 1&frac12; weeks now. <a href="/blog/visiting-mario-in-hospital">I visited him last Sunday</a>; and today, I paid him another visit. Man, what a change he's been through! He looks much, much better now. No more oxygen, no more <abbr title="Intravenous">IV</abbr> &mdash; he's well on his way to recovery. And plenty of friends and family are visiting him regularly, lifting his spirits, and helping him get better. Fingers crossed, according to the doctors he should be coming home tomorrow.</p>
