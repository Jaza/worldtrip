<p>I decided to cook some pasta napolitana tonight, at <a href="/blog/gullivers-house-rome">Gulliver's House</a> &mdash; I'd already made some last night &mdash; but tonight, I had no vegies to put in it! So I decided to chop up a banana, and so see what fried banana tastes like, when simmered with some crushed tomatoes. Piece of advice: don't try this at home, kids. It's edible &mdash; but I can see why I've never seen it in a cookbook. Rather disgusting &mdash; banana napolitana is a recipe to save only for the most dire of emergencies.</p>
