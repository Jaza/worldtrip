<p>Ayuko is a lovely Japanese girl, who's studying to be an English teacher over in Birmingham. She came here to Bath for a weekend holiday, and she's staying at <a href="/blog/st-christophers-inn-bath">St. Christopher's</a> along with the rest of us. Her English is pretty good, but she'll have to keep working on it before she can start teaching it. She enjoys the odd cocktail or two, and she carries origami paper with her wherever she goes &mdash; in case she needs to make anyone an emergency Japanese souvenir.</p>
