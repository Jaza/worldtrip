<p><em>Poor little critter stares back at you from the plate.</em></p>
<p>The verdict: tasty, and quite unique, but not something I'm desperate to try again. <em>Cuy</em> consists mainly of skin and feet, with a decidedly unimpressive amount of actual meat. I guess this can be attributed to the fact that guinea pigs are pretty lazy, and don't really move around and develop their muscles much.</p>

<p><em>Me, mercilessly tucking in to some cuy.</em></p>
<p>Cath wasn't game to try the <em>cuy</em>: well, she's a vegetarian anyway, so there was no way she was going to eat any. She was also a bit repulsed by the way we devoured it: because there's so little meat on it, you really have to tear the whole thing apart in order to find the good bits.</p>
