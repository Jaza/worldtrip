<p>This morning, <a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a> and I caught a bus from Copacabana to La Paz. But before we could get the bus, we had to buy our tickets. And as with everything in Bolivia, buying bus tickets is a process unlike what you'd expect it to be.</p>
<p>First, I went back to the company that we took to get from Puno to Copacabana, and I asked for two tickets on the 10am bus to La Paz this morning. <em>No problem</em>, said the lady in the office; and then she ran off down the street, without explaining why. Then, she returned after about 5 minutes, holding some kind of vouchers, and said, <em>that'll be Bs. 18 each</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm... that's strange</em>, I said. <em>Yesterday, when we got here and enquired about tickets to La Paz, you said that they were Bs. 20 each. Why are they less now?</em></p>
<p><em>Because this is with a different company</em>, explained the lady.</p>
<p><em>Riiight</em>, I responded. <em>So, how much does it cost if I just go to this different company, and buy the tickets from them?</em></p>
<p><em>Errr...</em> &mdash; the lady hesitated, realising that she'd made a mistake, and that she shouldn't have explained about the different company, and that now she had no choice but to continue explaining &mdash; <em>then it's Bs. 15</em>.</p>
<p><em>O-kay</em>, I said, unable but to smile at the craziness of it all. <em>So where do I go?</em></p>
<p><em>Just down the street, in front of the buses you can buy the tickets</em>, the lady said, pointing down the road to where several buses were parked.</p>
<p>So I walked down the road, and bought the two tickets to La Paz for Bs. 15 each. And we got the 10am bus just fine. I don't know for sure, but I have a strong suspicion that the company we came to Copacabana with doesn't actually go to La Paz at all &mdash; they just try and flog off a few tickets from other companies as middle-men. Never underestimate the number of middle-men you can have, in this part of the world &mdash; and every extra layer is a few extra coins going out of your pocket, and into various other peoples' pockets.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's how they do business in Bolivia.</p>
