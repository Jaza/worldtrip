<p>I cannot for the life of me remember where I first met Alan. It was somewhere else in Mexico :P. Anyway, we crossed paths again in Palenque, and we ended up hanging out together, along with a few other people, in the jungle for a few days. Alan's in his late 30s, and he's been travelling for a long time. But I felt that all his travelling has kept him young at heart. He's been all around South America, and he has plenty of stories to tell about that.</p>

<p><em>Alan's second from the right.</em></p>
<p>By sheer coincidence, Alan and I both need to be in Mexico City by next Monday, although we have slightly different plans for how to fill the interim. But we're probably going to at least travel to San Crist√≥bal together.</p>
