<p>Along with various other new arrivals, one of the people that I met at the much-frequented <a href="/blog/kabul-hostel-barcelona">Kabul</a> bar this evening was a guy from Sicily! This fellow's in his early 30s: and although all his family are from Sicily, he's now living and working in Ireland. He was very impressed when I told him about the <a href="/blog/great-sicilian-ride-the-wrapup">Great Sicilian Ride</a> that I did; and he was even more impressed with the fact that I knew where his home village was! He said he was from "near <a href="/blog/long-ride-via-caltanissetta">Caltanissetta</a>"; to which I replied: "ah, Caltanissetta! It must also be near Pietraperzia, and <a href="/blog/lost-near-piazza-armerina">Piazza Armerina</a> &mdash; I rode through those places." The Sicilian came with us to the <a href="/blog/flamenco-encore">Flamenco encore</a> this evening.</p>
