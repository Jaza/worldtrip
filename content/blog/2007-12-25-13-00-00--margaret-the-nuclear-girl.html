<p>Margaret's an American woman who's currently living in sunny California, and who works as an engineer in her nation's nuclear power plants. Pretty full-on job, eh? I watch <a href="http://www.snpp.com/">The Simpsons</a>, so I know <em>exactly</em> how gruelling and high-pressure an occupation that can be (mmmm... donuts :P). Margaret's staying here in Kitzbühel &mdash; at <a href="/blog/snowbunnys-hostel-kitzbuhel">Snowbunnys</a> &mdash; for a few days; and like the rest of us, she's here to carve up the slopes with some skiing, Austrian-style.</p>
