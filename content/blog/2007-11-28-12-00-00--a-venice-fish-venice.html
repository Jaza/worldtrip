<p>Good hostels (and, quite often, <em>any</em> hostels) are hard to come by in Italy: but <em>A Venice Fish</em> was a lucky find, in a city where a good place to stay makes all the difference. This hostel is clean and friendly, and it has charm and a laid-back atmosphere. But without a doubt, the main selling-point of the Fish is its free dinners: not only are they a huge cash-saver in this most pricey of cities; they're also delicious, and a great way to meet and greet <em>all</em> your fellow guests at the hostel. This is the first free-dinner hostel I've stayed at in Europe; and not surprisingly, it's also the most fun I've had at a hostel on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Good hostels (and, quite often, <em>any</em> hostels) are hard to come by in Italy: but <em>A Venice Fish</em> was a lucky find, in a city where a good place to stay makes all the difference. This hostel is clean and friendly, and it has charm and a laid-back atmosphere. But without a doubt, the main selling-point of the Fish is its free dinners: not only are they a huge cash-saver in this most pricey of cities; they're also delicious, and a great way to meet and greet <em>all</em> your fellow guests at the hostel.

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> clean 6-bed dorms, nice and quiet all night long.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> <a href="/blog/the-venice-fish-crew">fantabulous crowd</a> of fellow fun-loving, laid-back, predominantly English-speaking backpackers &mdash; great to chat with, great to drink with.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> what can I say, except that <a href="/blog/the-persian-of-venice">the Persian</a> is a champ &mdash; he cooks sumptuous dinners night after night, and he keeps the place running single-handedly.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> smack bang on the main island of Venice, about 15 minutes' walk from the main train station, and a 20-minute walk from the historic centre at Piazza San Marco. Couldn't ask for more.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> the dinners rock! Spag bol most nights, but always some variation on the theme &mdash; and it's basically all-you-can-eat. Sadly, no breakfast included: but you get full use of the well-equipped kitchen during the day.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> supposedly one free PC, but the 'Net wasn't working on it while I was there (although the machine itself was). By the way, Internet in Venice (like most things) is an utter ripoff: my advice is simply <em>do not go online</em> while in the city; unless super-urgent, it can wait 'til your next destination.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> strong and reliable.</p>
