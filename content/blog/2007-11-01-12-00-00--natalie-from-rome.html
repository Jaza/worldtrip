<p>Natalie's the young, space-cadet English girl who lives and works at <a href="/blog/gullivers-house-rome">Gulliver's House</a>, here in Rome. She's been here for about 3 months now, and she's not sure exactly how long she's staying for. She's extremely nice, but she's totally spaced out: not sure if she's stoned, or just a very tranquil person. Anyway, she's very welcoming to all the guests at the hostel, and she's always happy to give advice about what to see and do in the city.</p>
