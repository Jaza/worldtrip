<p>To continue my <a href="/blog/exploring-barcelona">wanderings in Barcelona</a>, this afternoon I took advantage of the improved weather, and I decided to go for a walk up to Montjuïc. This hill &mdash; literally meaning "hill of the Jews" &mdash; holds some of the city's most important landmarks; and from its slopes and peak, it affords gorgeous views of the whole of Barcelona. I started by walking west up Las Ramblas, and by then cutting south, along the main avenue that leads to the hill. I passed between the two towers that guard the main road up to the hill; and I ascended the lavishly decorated hillside that faces this road, and that's flanked by numerous museums, sweeping stairways and grand fountains. After, I wandered further up the hill, getting quite near to the 1992 Olympic Stadium, before wandering down past the <em>teleférico</em> (cable car) that straddles the eastern hillside, ahead of the onset of dark.</p>
