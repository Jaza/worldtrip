<p><a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a> and I were wandering around Puno after dinner this evening, when we encountered a big festivity taking place in the middle of the street, just round the corner from our hostel. Not sure exactly what the locals were celebrating; but they had a good old bonfire going in the middle of the (dirt) road; there was a most impressive brass band playing; and an impressive number of locals (with surprisingly few <em>gringos</em>) were standing around the fire in a big circle, with a few dancing in the middle. Good fun to watch, and everyone seemed friendly enough about letting us in to the circle of spectators.</p>

<p>There was one really strange guy (actually, he was probably just really drunk), who spent about &frac12; an hour straight standing right next to the fire &mdash; often with his arms outstretched, and his eyes meditatively closed &mdash; willing all the smoke to billow towards him. If he didn't look so obviously trashed, I might have thought he was performing some sort of vitally important ceremony. But I believe that all he was really doing was getting himself really, really smelly. There was also one very enthusiastic girl, who was dancing <a href="/blog/huayno-dancing-class">huayno</a> near the fire for a long time. Every now and then, she'd let the drunk fella have a dance with her, being the good sport that she was.</p>
