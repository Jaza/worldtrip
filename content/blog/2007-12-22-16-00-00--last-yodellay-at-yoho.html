<p>As with the previous two nights, my final night here at <a href="/blog/yoho-hostel-salzburg">Yoho</a> in Salzburg was a blast. No need to go out: more than enough fun to be had, simply by "going out downstairs" &mdash; and considering the cold, that's the best type of going out you can do around here. Big group, lots of beer-drinking (and mainly "wheat beer", which they have on tap at the Yoho bar, and which I far prefer over other beers), plenty of <a href="/blog/circle-of-death">card-playing</a>, and plenty of laughs. I'm really going to miss this place: and it's hard to believe that my next destination is probably going to be <em>even better!</em> Austria, you're giving me a good run.</p>
