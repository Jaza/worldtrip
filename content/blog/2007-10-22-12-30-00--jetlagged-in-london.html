<p>I was rather silly today, for my first day in England: I arrived at <a href="/blog/generator-hostel-london">The Generator</a> at about 7am this morning; and once there, I promptly went to bed. <em>"I'll just have a nap for a few hours"</em>, I told myself, <em>"my alarm's set for 10am".</em> Big mistake! My alarm didn't wake me, of course; and when next I woke, I discovered that it was 2 in the afternoon. Oh s$%# &mdash; perfect recipe for jetlag. Should have kept myself awake all day today, and crashed in the evening. I guess that <a href="/blog/god-speed-america">being in The Americas</a> for so long has made me forget about jetlag, as it's been a while since I had significant time zone differences to cope with. I can only hope that it will only take me a few days to recover from my mistake, and to adjust to <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>.</p>
