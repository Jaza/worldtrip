<p>It's always nice to find a tour agency in a non-English-speaking country, that advertises having services available in English. But when the advertisement for this service is written in dubiously-grammatised English, it does make you just a little apprehensive of the quality of said service. Here's a photo of the sign for a tour agency here in Potosí &mdash; the sign reads: <em>"the guide speak English"</em>. Is that so? Well, if he does, then I hope it's better than yours! :P</p>
