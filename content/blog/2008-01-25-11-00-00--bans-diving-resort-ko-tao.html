<p><a href="http://www.amazingkohtao.com/">Ban's</a> is one of the biggest resort / diving-school joints in Ko Tao: but don't let this put you off. It's a great school: highly experienced instructors, friendly service, and all the support you could need. It's a great resort: lovely rooms, a superb bar / restaurant, and an unbeatable location. Plus, despite all that, it still manages to offer pricing competitive with many of its lesser rivals; and even more amazingly, it still manages to retain a cosy, chilled and friendly vibe. <a href="/blog/alex-and-caroline">Alex, Caroline</a> and myself stayed at Ban's for four nights (accommodation complementary with the <abbr title="Professional Association of Diving Instructors">PADI</abbr> course), and we had a blast here.</p>

<p><em>As far as location goes, Ban's ain't bad.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> above my usual standard so far in Thailand &mdash; clean, secure and quiet.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> if you're staying at Ban's, then it means you're diving; and if you're diving, then it means you rock. Hence, the people at Ban's all rock :P.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> also divers &mdash; hence, they also all rock. Instructors are all champs, and the reception staff are also courteous and professional.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> middle of Sairee, right on the beach &mdash; doesn't get much better.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> the restaurant (slash bar) serves up excellent dishes, at the same standard (albeit over-inflated) prices as every other restaurant on the island. Western food available too, should your cravings demand it.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> available in reception at the standard ripoff Ko Tao rate of 2B/min &mdash; Internet's too expensive, and Ko Tao's too nice, to waste your time online while you're here.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> as with most places in Thailand, it hasn't got it, and you don't need it.</p>
