<p>Two of my buddies during <a href="/blog/cooking-in-chiang-mai">today's cooking class</a> were a couple from Spain. They didn't speak much English (particularly the girl) &mdash; and even less Thai &mdash; so they were relieved to find someone else in the group whom they could communicate with. That person being <em>yo, por supuesto.</em> Speaking English here in Thailand is pretty much essential &mdash; so I guess they speak enough to get by. The guy is true-blue Spanish; but the girl's originally <em>una colombiana.</em> They're here in Thailand for a short winter vacation, before they head back to Europe. They did a reasonable job at following the all-English cooking instructions today; although I did help them a bit, by translating the odd word now and then.</p>
