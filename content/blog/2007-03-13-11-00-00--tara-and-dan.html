<p>This Aussie couple happened to be in Palenque at the same time as me, and along with <a href="/blog/alan-the-brit">Alan</a>, I wound up spending some time in the jungle with them. They've both been everywhere, sometimes together, sometimes alone. They're both willing to try really crazy things; but Tara's really funny, because she just naturally looks a lot more sensible and careful than she is. They're also both from Sydney.</p>
