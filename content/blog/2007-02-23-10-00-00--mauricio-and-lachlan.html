<p>How I managed to meet Mauricio (and, in turn, Lachlan) was another case of fate being <em>mi mejor amigo</em>. A few days ago, a guy called <a href="http://gnrfan.org/">Antonio Ognio</a>, in Peru, emailed me with a <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> support query. When I emailed him back and told him I was in Mexico, he said that I had to visit his <abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> friend Mauricio, if I was going to be in Xalapa. Well, it just so turns out that here I am in Xalapa!</p>

<p>Mauricio is a local, as well as a Linux sysadmin for Essanda. Lachlan is Mauricio's boss, and he's an Aussie guy from Sydney! Lachlan's a really nice, interesting, and well-travelled guy (as well as a fully qualified surgeon, of all things).</p>
<p>Mauricio and Lachlan were incredibly hospitable. Today, they dropped whatever they were meant to be doing for their Friday's work, and decided to be our tourguides and all-round <em>amigos</em> for the day (with 'us' being myself and Steve). They took us for lunch, showed us the Anthropology Museum, and hung around and chatted a great deal.</p>
