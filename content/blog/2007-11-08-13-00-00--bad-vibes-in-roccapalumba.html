<p>This afternoon I continued riding south, <a href="/blog/the-caccamo-climb">from Caccamo</a>, into the hilly region that is the traditional Mafia heartland of Sicily. One town in particular &mdash; a place called Roccapalumba &mdash; gave me very bad vibes when I rode through it. Normally, the locals here in Sicily are quite friendly: but not around here. Everyone in Roccapalumba was giving me harsh, unfriendly, suspicious stares as I whizzed through their town; made me feel very creepy indeed. Lots of funny old men with dirty faces and beady eyes; young dudes on motorbikes with big tattoos on their shoulders; and signs for strange nearby attractions, such as "planetarium observatory". Glad I'm not spending the night here; I only wish it weren't so late in the day, as I'm inevitably not going to make it too far for my evening's rough camping.</p>
