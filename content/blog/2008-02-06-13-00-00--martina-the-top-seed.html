<p>Like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Hingis">famous tennis player</a>, Martina is a thin, athletic girl from the fair realm of Switzerland. Martina hails from a small mountain village in the south-eastern region of Switzerland, where she's lucky enough to have been skiing her entire life. She now spends most of her winter months in a ski town in the country's Italian region, where she pays her way by working as a café waitress. Martina is fluent in German, English, French, Italian and Spanish &mdash; an impressive repertoire, even by (the not-too-shabby) Swiss standards. Martina climbed with me during <a href="/blog/fun-on-the-rocks">this afternoon's session</a>, where she blew us all away by conquering a climb that no-one else could.</p>
