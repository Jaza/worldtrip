<p>Clearly, the lack of loose change is not something specific to Mexico, but rather, something that's widespread throughout the Latin world. Today, on my first day in South America, the <a href="/blog/no-tengo-cambio">no tengo cambio</a> saga reached maddening heights of frustration, as a taxi driver refused to accept a 50-<em>sole</em> bill from me.</p>
<p>I was catching a taxi from the <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a> to Lima's Chabad House, for my Peruvian Seder night. When we arrived at the Chabad House, the driver requested the already-agreed-upon amount of 7 <em>soles</em>. I offered him a 50-<em>sole</em> bill, and he gave me a look like I was from Mars. <em>"Sorry"</em>, I said, <em>"that's all I have"</em>.</p>
<p><em>"Why don't you go inside and ask for change?"</em> he suggested. <em>"I'll wait here".</em> So I reluctantly went inside the Chabad House, and asked everyone around for change. No luck.</p>
<p>When I came back out, the taxi driver was just about to give up and drive off; but I signalled him to stop and to wait a bit longer. I ran up to anyone walking by on the street, and asked if they had change for a 50. No luck.</p>
<p>Finally I found someone who didn't have change for a 50, but who was generous enough to spare what I needed. A religious mother was backing her people-mover out of the driveway of the Chabad House. I asked her for change, and after fumbling around in her purse, she fished out 2 US dollars, and handed them to me. The going rate is USD$1 to s/3, so that was 6 soles. I was able to make up the rest from my own loose change.</p>
<p>After, I decided to prepare myself for the next time I'd need change, by getting some now, in advance. So I walked around to about 5 shops in the area, asking for change from a 50. Everybody refused. Finally, I went to a bank, and after standing in line for 15 minutes, they gave me my change. Even the shop that shared its retail space with the bank refused to give change &mdash; I mean hell, it must be <em>sooo</em> hard for them to get change, I bet they're always running out!</p>
<p>The really crazy thing was, I <em>did</em> try to avoid this right from the start. I actually asked the hostel for change, before I left and caught the taxi. But guess what? They didn't have change either. Argh! So goddamn frustrating!</p>
