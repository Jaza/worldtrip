<p>This morning began our tour of the Salar de Uyuni, the world's highest and biggest salt flat. After a brief visit to the <a href="/blog/uyuni-train-cemetery">Uyuni train cemetery</a>, we took off to the flats themselves. Our group has six people (plus our guide, Raul, and his son, <a href="/blog/willy">Willy</a>): myself, <a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a>, <a href="/blog/leila-and-christina">Leila, Christina</a>, another Swiss (an older woman, can't remember her name), and a French dude (can't remember his name either). We drove across the salt flats in our Land Cruiser 4WD this morning, and it made for a very salty morning indeed.</p>

<p>A lot of people take cool trick photographs on the salt flats, because since it's flat and white all around, there's no field of reference, and hence perception becomes a relative thing when put into a photograph. I didn't do the whole trick photo thing; but I still got plenty of great shots.
