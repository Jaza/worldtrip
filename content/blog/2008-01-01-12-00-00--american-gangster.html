<p>Like Madrid itself, we were feeling extremely lazy and <em>tranquilo</em> today: so after our <a href="/blog/paella"><em>paella</em> lunch, <a href="/blog/miguel-the-mexican">Miguel</a>, <a href="/blog/emmanuelle-from-new-caledonia">Emmanuelle</a>, the Aussie Indian girl (Shomare) and myself cruised over to one of the city's many cinema complexes. We decided to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429/">American Gangster</a>, a new Ridley Scott film starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. Very well-produced movie, although quite violent and a little disturbing. The film was dubbed: and although I've by now seen plenty of Spanish-dubbed movies, the "Spanish Spanish" took quite a while to get used to (all that lisping and rapid-fire talking, it hurts my poor <em>Peruano</em> ears). Miguel obviously had no problem with the dubbing; but Emmanuelle and Shomare didn't understand much of what was happening. They just came along for the ride.</p>
