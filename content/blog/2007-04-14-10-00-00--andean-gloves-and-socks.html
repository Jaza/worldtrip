<p>Just a few nice, cheap, traditional bits of clothing, to keep me warm on my upcoming <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">Salkantay hike</a>. As with all the local clothes here, they're hand-made, stitched with Cusqueña patterned designs, and (ostensibly) made from Alpaca. I could have got a local beanie as well, but I figured that would be just too touristy.</p>
