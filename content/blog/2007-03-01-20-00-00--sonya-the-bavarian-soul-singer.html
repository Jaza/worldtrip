<p>Sonya was staying at the hostel in Valladolid on my first night there. She's beautiful &mdash; she looks like a 40's movie star &mdash; and she has a voice like an angel. <a href="/blog/dave-from-nyc">Dave from NYC</a> wanted her something bad (he wants everything with breasts and 2 legs <em>something bad</em>, though), and I think she really liked him, too. She's in a <a href="http://the-troubleshooters.de/">14-person soul band</a>, back home in Bavaria, Germany.</p>
