<p>For my third foray into the delicious world of Spanish <em>tapas</em>, today I decided to try a dish called <em>Pimientos del Padron</em>. It's quite a simple one, really: just baby green peppers (i.e. capsicum) lightly pan-fried, and served with a sprinkling of salt. Reasonably filling, and quite tasty; although not the best value-for-money I've ever come across. But then again, value is a rare find indeed, here in Barcelona.</p>
