<p>I woke up this morning, to find Otavalo completely transformed. Outside my hostel was a market. Down the street was more market. In fact, the entire town had been converted into one giant, sprawling, souvenir-riddled market! So the rumours were true: it is indeed a big deal, here in Otavalo on Saturday. And since this was my last full day in Ecuador, and in the Central Andes as a whole, it was time to embark on a serious splurge of souvenir and present shopping. I now have a very overstuffed bag, and a rather lean pocket.</p>

<p>I woke up this morning, to find Otavalo completely transformed. Outside my hostel was a market. Down the street was more market. In fact, the entire town had been converted into one giant, sprawling, souvenir-riddled market! So the rumours were true: it is indeed a big deal, here in Otavalo on Saturday. And since this was my last full day in Ecuador, and in the Central Andes as a whole, it was time to embark on a serious splurge of souvenir and present shopping. I now have a very overstuffed bag, and a rather lean pocket.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have the photos to prove it (more on that sad issue tomorrow, folks) &mdash; but here's what I bought in Otavalo this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 knitted llamas (also made from llama wool)</li>
<li>2 sets of fat, hand-made colouring pencils</li>
<li>1 little playing drum</li>
<li>1 pink, little-girl-sized alpaca jumper</li>
<li>1 medium-sized men's alpaca jumper</li>
<li>1 alpaca bath mat</li>
<li>1 pair of alpaca slippers</li>
<li>1 ceramic model of a market stall</li>
<li>1 hand-carved highland chess set</li>
<li>4 small highland paintings</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure exactly how much all that cost me, but it must have been at least US$70. No small spend, eh? Oh well, it's my last chance to buy proper, South American souvenirs &mdash; none of this "indigenous stuff" down in Chile / Argentina / Brazil. And I haven't done that much shopping down here so far, anyway.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder who's getting what? 'Cause all of this was present shopping. At any rate, the "pink, little-girl-sized alpaca jumper" is certainly not for me. :P</p>
<p>It was great fun, wandering through the endless market stalls this morning, checking out what was on offer, and of course engaging in plenty of good, old-fashioned bargaining. Wasn't <em>too</em> packed with tourists, either: at least, not with <em>gringo</em> tourists &mdash; I think the majority of shoppers were Quite√±os, just come down for the morning on the bus. Anyway, after I'd spent all morning browsing and shopping, I found myself carting around a massive garbage bag full of goodies. Once I was in this state, I decided it was time to grab some lunch, and to hop on a bus back to Quito, for my final night in Ecuador.</p>
