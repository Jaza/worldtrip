<p>Grabbed one of these snacks on the side of the street this afternoon, in Baños. It's fairly simple &mdash; a deep-fried banana, with a slit cut down the middle, and some highland cheese stuffed inside &mdash; but it tastes great. You really can do anything with bananas &mdash; batter them, fry them, boil them, bake them, grill them, or whatever else &mdash; and they're still sensational pieces of fruit. Recommended if you're ever somewhere in Ecuador, and craving something light yet filling for an afternoon feed.</p>
