<p>Several different locals here in Mérida told me that <a href="http://www.bushorchimp.com/">President George W. Bush</a> is going to be here, in town, today! I found this hard to believe, so I did a bit of research, and it looks like <a href="http://www.yucatanliving.com/news/calderon-bush-in-yucatan.htm">it could be true</a>. Anyway, I was off at Uxmal all day today, and I didn't really notice a thing. But it's kinda cool to know that I was in town with the world's most powerful and most stupid man.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bush will be visiting Merida from March 12th through the 14th, according to newspaper articles. Once again, the leaders and their cadre of security and courtiers will end up at the remote and luxurious Hacienda Temozon, far from prying eyes and the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article gives a later date, but hey, maybe the government just leaked an incorrect date on purpose, and the big fella turned up early for security reasons.</p>
