<p>José is about as close to the "stereotypical Mexican dude" as you can get: he reminds me a bit of <a href="http://vote-for-pedro.com/">Pedro</a> from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/">Napoleon Dynamite</a>. He comes from Mexico City, but he's been living in Europe for the past few months, and he has an Austrian girlfriend down in Vienna. José was the first person I met this evening at <a href="/blog/bobs-youth-hostel-amsterdam">Bob's</a> (he's in the same room as me); and as soon as he saw me, he suggested that we go out and hit a few pubs. Amazingly, he's one of the few other people at Bob's who's not (completely) stoned.</p>
