<p>Adam's one of the quieter and less permanently-drunk Irishmen I've met over the past year. Nevertheless, he's still a right good ambassador of his booze-loving homeland: he can down his <a href="/blog/one-two-three-bucket-floor">buckets</a> all night with the best of 'em. Adam's been in my <a href="/blog/padi-diving-course-begins">Open Water course</a> since Friday; although somehow, I managed to avoid meeting him properly until today. Once we met, it didn't take long for us to click &mdash; or for the glasses to clink.</p>
