<p><em>The Amantaní crew: they will rock you.</em></p>
<p>Before we left for the party, our host families got us all dressed up in "traditional island garb". For the boys, we had to each don a big, baggy woollen poncho, as well as an over-the-ears Inca-style beanie.</p>

<p><em>Not that it looks silly or anything.</em></p>

<p>For the ladies, it was a bit more elaborate. Also a big 'ol over-the-ears beanie; but on top of that, a colourful blouse, and a really big, puffed-up skirt. For all of us, it got real hot real quick on the dance floor.</p>

<p>The party was pretty lively. Once the music got started, the local women started dancing in a big circle, and they (literally) dragged all of us <em>gringos</em> out of our seats, and invited us to join in with them. The circle dancing was pretty easy for me, because apart from the titanic arm-swinging that was involved, it was pretty much the same as the Jewish folk dancing that I've been doing at weddings and barmitzvahs (and Simchat Torahs!) for my whole life.</p>
<p>After the circle dancing, we got into some partner dancing with the local ladies. Some of the local girls were a bit lacking in energy and enthusiasm; but others were prancing us around the room, rapidly making us tired and sweaty beneath our elephantine woollen garb. Personally, I didn't mind: it was the best fun I've had in yonks; and once I got into it, I couldn't stop!</p>
