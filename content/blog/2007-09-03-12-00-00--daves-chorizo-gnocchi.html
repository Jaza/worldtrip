<p>The <a href="/blog/spag-bol-at-patanuk">spag bol</a> last night just wasn't enough: tonight, we were up for some more Italian! My mate <a href="/blog/dave-from-kangaroo-island">Dave</a> cooked up a fantastic gnocchi tonight (gnocchi being my favourite food on Earth), with the rich tomato sauce full of fried, chopped-up <em>chorizo</em> (sausage). Because Argentina has had so many Italian immigrants over the years, foods such as gnocchi are widely sold in supermarkets everywhere. Sensational dinner &mdash; and accompanied by plenty of the red wine that seems to be standard with every meal around here.</p>
