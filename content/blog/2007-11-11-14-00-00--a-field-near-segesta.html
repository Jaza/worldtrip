<p>By the time I was done <a href="/blog/segesta-ruins">visiting Segesta</a> this afternoon, I had very little daylight left, and thus precious little time for stopping and finding a campsite. Thankfully, however, I didn't need to go very far, or to look very hard: all around Segesta was rolling farmed countryside, much of it perfect for rough camping, and packed with little dirt trails and often-unfenced fields. So I only rode for about 20 minutes more &mdash; crossing under the nearby <em>autostrada</em> and train line in the process &mdash; before I found a spot that was just right for me. Nothing grand: just a little vineyard, with a long road leading into the heart of the fields, and with a fence that was missing in many places; and with plenty of nice, green space amongst the vines for pitching my tent, and far enough away from the farmhouses to afford some privacy as well.</p>

<p><em>Camped amongst the vines.</em></p>
<p>I was a bit reluctant to squat in a vineyard at first &mdash; normally, so far my rough camping has been in ploughed fields that are semi-disused; and this place was clearly in use. Plus, there were a few dogs barking just over the ridge; but thankfully, they didn't discover me, or bother me apart from making a bit of noise. It was still windy in the evening: I was hoping that the vines would afford me some protection; but they were hardly a help at all, the tent still got reasonably buffeted. Anyway, I managed to set up and to cook and eat just fine, and I got a solid night's sleep.</p>
