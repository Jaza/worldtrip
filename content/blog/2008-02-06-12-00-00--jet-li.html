<p>This dude's real name is "Let", and he's my main instructor for the <a href="/blog/rock-climbing-course-begins">three-day climbing course</a> that I'm doing here at Ton Sai. When I told Let that my name was "Jeremy", he had a lot of difficulty pronouncing it &mdash; the closest he could get was "Jet Li", and so that is now my official rock-climbing pseudonym. Let's a really nice guy: he's only been rock-climbing himself (let alone instructing!) for the past six months; before that, he spent ten years as a chef in a glamorous hotel restaurant in Phuket. His ability and his fitness levels are remarkable, considering how new he is to the sport; and after only six months of working with <em>farangs</em>, his English ain't so bad either.</p>
