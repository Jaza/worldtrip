<p><a href="http://www.st-christophers.co.uk/bath-hostels">St. Christopher's Inn</a> is a great little hostel in the pub-infested centre of Bath. The bottom floor of the place is a regular pub, actually &mdash; open to the public every evening, and it gets just as many locals as it goes guests coming for a drink. It's not the greatest value for money (but nothing is in Bath), and it does have a few eccentric little annoyances; but it's good fun, and a nice place to crash for a few nights.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.st-christophers.co.uk/bath-hostels">St. Christopher's Inn</a> is a great little hostel in the pub-infested centre of Bath. The bottom floor of the place is a regular pub, actually &mdash; open to the public every evening, and it gets just as many locals as it goes guests coming for a drink. It's not the greatest value for money (but nothing is in Bath), and it does have a few eccentric little annoyances; but it's good fun, and a nice place to crash for a few nights.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> fairly basic &mdash; a bit crowded, and the noise and light from the street outside can be bad on weekends.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> nice crowd, all young backpackers &mdash; best to meet people in the secret common room up top, rather than down in the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> the bar stuff down in the pub double as hostel reception staff. They'll give you the keys and take your money, but that's about it.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> centre of Bath, 5 minute walk from the bus and train stations, and near all the pubs and shops.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> the free breakfast isn't bad, and is all-you-can-eat. Don't buy lunch or dinner here (you can get it downstairs, in the pub) &mdash; mega ripoff.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> super-ripoff Â£1 per 20 minutes, and only 1 PC available. But that's standard for Bath. My advice is to just not go online while in this town.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> nice and hot &mdash; but the special "water-saving taps" need to be whacked every 5 seconds, or the shower just stops! Very annoying.</p>
