<p>Buenos Aires is the most Jewish city in Latin America, and one of the only places on this continent where you can find kosher restaurants lining the streets, and orthodox Jews roaming the sidewalks. As part of my <a href="/blog/its-sunny-lets-ride">bike tour of <abbr title="Buenos Aires">BA</abbr></a> today, I also included a tour of "kosher street" &mdash; otherwise known as <em>"busca al yok"</em> (lit: "spot the yok") :P. Just as Sydney has O'Brien St in Bondi, and Melbourne has Carlyle St in Caulfield, so too does BA have Calle Tucumán in Once. Everything Jewish you could ever want is here: religious bookstores; orthodox schools and kindergartens; and best of all, kosher <em>parrillas</em> (steak houses)! Dad, if you ever visit BA, now you'll know where to go.</p>

<p>Hey, I went to the only Kosher McDonalds outside of Israel last year and the meat is terrific. But let´s face it, eating Kosher is not easy and it is hard to find kosher things. But here is a tip, when I travelled to Argentina, I found <a href="http://www.clickaparts.com" title="Kosher apartments in Buenos Aires">Kosher apartments in Buenos Aires </a>.<br />
The experience was really good.<br />
I highly recommend it.<br />
