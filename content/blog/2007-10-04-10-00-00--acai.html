<p>There are many countries in South America where you can find great, fresh, delicious tropical fruit juices &mdash; from fruits such as papaya, mango, guava, passionfruit, and various berries. But only in Brazil can you find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD_Palm"><em>açaí</em></a>. This delicious &mdash; and incredibly nutritious &mdash; fruit is found only in tropical Brazil, and it's used to make some of the most extraordinary juices and smoothies known to man. I had some <em>açaí</em> for breakfast this morning, and by G-d, the stuff was simply out of this world. If you're in Brazil any time soon, don't go home until you've tried some of it &mdash; and once you've tried it, you won't want to go home at all.</p>
