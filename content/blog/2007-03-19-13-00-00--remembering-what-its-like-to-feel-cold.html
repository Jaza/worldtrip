<p>It's pretty cold and pretty rainy here in San Francisco today. And that feels really weird to me. I got so spoilt in Mexico! After a month of almost constant sun and warmth, I've virtually forgotten what it's like to feel cold. But now I remember how it feels: crap. Anyway, I'm going to have to get used to it, because almost everywhere else I'm going on my trip is probably going to be fairly cold. Including my next stop, Vancouver.</p>

<p>When the weather gets bad in San Francisco, a really icy wind picks up, and blows in from the bay, all over the city. That's what it's like today. Anyway, plenty of hot tea and some nice Chinatown <em>Number 22 Please</em> food should keep me in good stead.</p>
