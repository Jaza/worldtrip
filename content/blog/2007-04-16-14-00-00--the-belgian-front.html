<p>The two Belgian couples that were in my group on the <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">Salkantay hike</a> &mdash; Maes and Stef, Ellen and Stijn &mdash; will be fondly remembered for many things. They can drink beer until the cows come home. They can sing Waltzing Matilda. And they can honestly claim that they were part of the world-first <a href="/blog/the-australian-belgian-salute">Australian-Belgian salute</a>, at the top of the world in Peru. What's more, they truly are one of the friendliest bunch of people I've met on my trip so far.</p>
