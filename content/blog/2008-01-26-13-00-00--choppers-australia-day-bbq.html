<p><em>In joyful strains then let us sing,<br />
"Advance Australia fair!"</em><br />
<strong>Jan 26<sup>th</sup> &mdash; Happy Australia Day, folks!</strong>
</p>
<p>We may not know all the words to <a href="http://www.hamilton.net.au/advance.html">our national anthem</a> (and some even deny the existence of a second verse). We may have less respect for our politicians than for a skunk in rehab. But there's one grand tradition for which us Aussies do hold national pride: we know how to put on a good BBQ! So, to celebrate this momentous day &mdash; when, 220 years ago, an English dude landed on our beloved soil, whacked a Union Jack into the ground, and promptly impaled several tribes' worth of Aborigines upon it &mdash; the Aussies of Ko Tao pulled out the grill and sizzled up some sossies. The fine folks at <a href="http://www.choppers-sportsbar.com/">Chopper's</a> (the one-and-only Aussie bar on the island) offered a free BBQ for 2 hours this evening: all you had to do was purchase a beer, and a generous plate-full of meat 'n' salad was on the house. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_America">Aus-tra-li-a, <strong>F$#% YEAH!!</strong></a></p>

<p>The BBQ was a mean spread: juicy steak; fat sausages; fresh salad; chunks of bread; and bucketloads of condiments. Don't get me wrong, Thai food is amazing: but after two weeks of nothing but rice and noodles, a good hunk of meat was very welcome. Chopper's was absolutely <em>packed</em> with Aussies this evening &mdash; we were the majority here by a long shot &mdash; and most of 'em were going absolutely mental, as well. Air-guitarring on table-tops, rugby-scrums on the dance floor, and beer-spilling to the horizon: if this was a bar back home, then half the patrons would have been booted out in no time; however, the largely Thai staff were excessively tolerant, and just kept cleaning up and smiling amidst the yobbery. They were also playing a smashing selection of Aussie live music downstairs: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC">Akka-Dakka</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Oil">Midnight Oil</a> songs drew cheers that could be heard from space; and let me tell you, hearing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khe_Sanh_(song)"><em>Khe Sanh</em></a> on Oz Day in Thailand was an experience not to be forgotten.
