<p>Kyden, Steve, and myself caught a taxi over to the <em>Grande Cenote</em> this afternoon. This is one of several <em>cenotes</em> (rock pools) in the area, that I learned are actually all joined together, through a vast, subterranean network of water tunnels. We hired some snorkels and fins at the <em>cenote</em>, and jumped in for a dazzling underwater adventure.</p>
<p>This was the first proper snorkelling I've ever done &mdash; certainly the first snorkelling where there's something worth seeing below the surface &mdash; and I have to say, it really blew me away. Under the water, there are delicately formed stalactites, mysterious rocky caves, and fish of all colours swimming everywhere.</p>
<p>And aside from the noise of breathing through the snorkel, everything is as peaceful as the surface of the Moon. In fact, in many ways &mdash; the silence, the cold, the stillness, and the alienness &mdash; I imagine it's the next best thing to actually going to the moon.</p>
<p>Sadly, I couldn't take any photos of this underwater world; but Steve had an underwater camera, so he got plenty of good snaps. Also, after only a short while (about 30 mins), it starts to get too cold to continue snorkelling, and you simply have to get out and lie in the sun.</p>
