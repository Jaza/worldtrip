<p>This is probably news to everyone outside of Latin America, but for the past few weeks, the <a href="http://www.copaamerica.com/">Copa América</a> soccer tournament has been going on in Caracas, Venezuela. And everywhere that I've been lately &mdash; i.e. Bolivia, Chile, and Brazil &mdash; it's been the No. 1 thing on everyone's mind, and the one-and-only thing on every television in the continent. Well, this afternoon we finally had the grand final, between Brazil and Argentina: the way it turned out was that Argentina got slaughtered, and Brazil won the game 3-0.</p>

<p>This is probably news to everyone outside of Latin America, but for the past few weeks, the <a href="http://www.copaamerica.com/">Copa América</a> soccer tournament has been going on in Caracas, Venezuela. And everywhere that I've been lately &mdash; i.e. Bolivia, Chile, and Brazil &mdash; it's been the No. 1 thing on everyone's mind, and the one-and-only thing on every television in the continent. Well, this afternoon we finally had the grand final, between Brazil and Argentina: the way it turned out was that Argentina got slaughtered, and Brazil won the game 3-0.</p>
<p>It was our final afternoon in Arequipa, and we spent it in the Irish pub near the plaza, which was of course packed with people, all come to watch the game. No place to watch a big sport game like an Irish pub! It was very exciting when Brazil got their first goal after only 5 minutes of play &mdash; but after that, it was a fairly eventless game, apart from the two additional goals, that Brazil got later in.</p>
<p>I don't usually follow soccer, or watch soccer games very much: but when something like the Copa América is on, and you're in South America, it's almost impossible to not hear about it constantly. Anyway, it was good seeing the grand final &mdash; until the next big game, perhaps people will talk about something else for a change. I have no idea what, though.</p>
