<p>I met these two guys in <em>Playa</em>, and we ended up travelling to Tulum together. Steve's a half-Aussie, half-Scottish, Miami-residing, aspiring Medicine student. Cody's an oil rig worker from Alberta, Canada. Both of them came down for spring break. Cody is trying to learn guitar (he brought one with him, but can't play it); he produces some ripper one-liners; and he seems to enjoy ridiculously good luck with women.</p>
