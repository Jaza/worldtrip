<p>When I was at the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">2007 OSCMS Summit</a> in San Francisco 2 weeks ago, my friend <a href="http://www.developmentseed.org/">Ian Ward</a> told me that I must visit Ayacucho &mdash; where he lived for 2 years, and where he met his wife &mdash; and that I must see his friend Abimael. Abimael is an English teacher and a post-grad student at the university here in Ayacucho, although he's never lived in an English-speaking country; in fact, he's never been outside Peru! In between these commitments, Abimael was nice enough to spend some time with me, and to <a href="/blog/ayacuchamay-lookout">show me around Ayacucho</a> a bit.</p>
