<p>Ba単os ain't got the name for nothing, you know: the place is surrounded by hot thermal baths. This afternoon, <a href="/blog/patrick-the-belgian">Patrick</a> and I decided to check some of them out. Unfortunately, we didn't end up having a dip after all. First, we got a bus which dropped us off at the wrong baths (cold and dirty ones), which we weren't too keen on hopping into. Then, when we finally reached the only baths in town worth going to (called <em>Piscina de la Virgen</em>), it turned out that they were closed for the afternoon (for cleaning, I think), and wouldn't open again until later in the evening. Bit of a pain. Ah well, maybe I'll try them another day.</p>
