<p>We finished off Adam's barmitzvah celebrations today, by doing something that we really didn't do enough of yesterday: <em>eating!</em> Hahahahaha... yeah <em>right</em>, as if we needed to eat more this weekend. This morning's brunch was an informal little affair, at the <a href="/blog/the-goldstein-bempechat-clan">Goldstein</a> house, where we just kinda popped in and shmoozed for a bit. The brunch was catered separately to yesterday's big lunch, which was insane &mdash; as yesterday's lunch has provided the Goldsteins with enough leftovers to end world hunger in 22% of Africa. Anyway, nice morning finale to the <em>simcha</em>.</p>
