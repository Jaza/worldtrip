<p>Lisa's a fun, beautiful, red-headed girl who's originally from Harrisburg (the capital of Pennsylvania &mdash; no, it's not Philadelphia), but who's been studying in Washington <abbr title="District of Columbia">DC</abbr> for several years now. Lisa's a smart cookie: she's almost finished her Master's in special needs education. I met Lisa this evening at <a href="/blog/yoho-hostel-salzburg">Yoho</a>, and as well as joining in on the Yoho drinkfest this evening, we also went on <a href="/blog/climb-every-mountain-do-every-tour">The Sound of Music tour</a> together the next day.</p>
