<p>For the first time so far on my trip, I went to the cinemas tonight in La Paz, and saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449088/">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</a> (the third and final instalment in the trilogy). Great movie, and an interesting experience going to the cinemas in Bolivia. They're screening movies until 10pm, but the last decent ones are at 7pm. They have numbered, reserved seating; but when you get inside, you can't see the numbers, so you just sit anywhere (then someone comes and moves you). And they turn the movie off as soon as the credits start rolling, so that you get out of there faster. Crazy place.</p>
