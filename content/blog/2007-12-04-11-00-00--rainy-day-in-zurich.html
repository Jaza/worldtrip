<p>I already <a href="/blog/exploring-zurich">explored Zürich</a> yesterday; today, I couldn't be a$$ed doing very much at all. What with the horrible weather outside, and with nothing in particular to see or do in the city, and with unlimited free Internet access right where I was, my choice seemed obvious enough. I just hung around inside <a href="/blog/mark-and-susi">Mark and Susi</a>'s apartment all day, catching up on a bit of blogging and online reading, mucking around with some Internet gadgets (such as the cool <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/help/maps/mymaps/index.html">custom map drawing</a> feature in <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>), and otherwise keeping warm and dry. My new <abbr title="Automatic Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> card still hasn't arrived: where the hell is it? It's supposed to be getting sent by express <a href="http://www.dhl.com/">DHL</a> courier; but it's been 4 days since it left Sydney, and there's still no sign of it. I hope it comes soon &mdash; because nice as it is staying with the family, I can't hang around here forever.</p>
