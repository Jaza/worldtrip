<p>I just realised that in the past week, I've seen more movies (most in English) than in any other week so far on my trip! The reason: the <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a> has a big TV, 50 cable channels, and a stash of DVDs; and we've been watching at least one movie a night, and sometimes more in the daytime, the whole time we've been here.</p>

<p>I just realised that in the past week, I've seen more movies (most in English) than in any other week so far on my trip!

<p>I can't remember everything I saw, but I definitely watched all or part of:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 Weddings and a Funeral</li>
<li>Apocalypto</li>
<li>Jackass 2</li>
<li>Syriana</li>
<li>50 First Dates</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, dodgy TV shows in between. Typical for the Easter / Pesach time of year: a couch potato week.</p>
