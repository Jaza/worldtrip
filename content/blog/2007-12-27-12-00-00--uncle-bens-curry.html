Tonight's dinner was quick, cheap and easy: with a bit of rice, a bit of vegies, and a bit of Uncle Ben's stir-fry curry mix, I had me a delicious (and enormous) serving of curry, courtesy of the <a href="/blog/snowbunnys-hostel-kitzbuhel">Snowbunnys</a> kitchen. Now that <a href="/blog/craig-sarah-and-kade">Craig, Sarah and Kade</a> have buggered off, I'm back to my usual big, unoriginal and economical cooking tricks &mdash; but hey, it floats my boat. And everyone <em>said</em> that it smelled great, too.</p>

<p>Tonight was a fairly chilled, easy-going evening in Kitzb√ºhel. After some quiet reading and a bite for dinner, I sat and lounged in front of the TV for a while &mdash; although none of us were able to find anything decent, even on the myriad of channels that are provided courtesy of <a href="/blog/dave-stressed-bunny">Dave</a>'s hacked satellite access (wasn't even anything exciting on the porn channels). I went out to <a href="/blog/flannigans-et-al">Flannigans</a> again with <a href="/blog/jake-and-mitch">Jake and Mitch</a>, but I wasn't particularly in the mood for excessive drinking or chatting (or passive smoking): I was too <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~ebarnes/python/dead-parrot.htm">tired and shagged out</a> to make it a big night, so I said goodbye early on, and hit the sack before something hit me. Jake said that he wasn't feeling well &mdash; his words were "I'll just say hello and have one beer, and that's it" &mdash; but despite this, he still didn't stumble back to the hostel until 5am the next morning. Crazy bastards.</p>
