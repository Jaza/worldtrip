<p>Tried charging my phone and my camera this morning. When I plugged them in, I got an error message on the screen saying "not charging". <em>Huh?</em> Clearly, the devices were getting some power, but <em>only</em> enough to realise that they weren't <em>getting</em> enough, and to tell me as much.</p>
<p>I took my phone, and related accessories, to a mobile phone dealer in Xalapa. With some seriously crap Spanish, I managed to convey to them that I needed some sort of transformer in order to make it charge.</p>
<p>Most fortunately, there was an <em>electrico</em> across the road, and the phone lady kindly escorted me over there, and helped explain my problem to the staff there.</p>
<p>I now have a 110V to 240V converter / transformer, which the <em>electrico</em> gave me for about 50 pesos; and now I can charge my devices just fine.</p>
