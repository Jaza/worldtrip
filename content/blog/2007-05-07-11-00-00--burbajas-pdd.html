<p>For the remaining two weeks of Spanish school that I've got at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>, I've decided that each day, there's going to be a <abbr title="Palabra Del Día">PDD</abbr>, or <em>Palabra Del Día</em> (lit: "Word Of The Day"). For today, the inaugural <abbr title="Palabra Del Día">PDD</abbr> is: <em>burbajas</em> ("bubbles"). You can blow <em>burbajas</em>. You can live in a <em>burbaja</em>. And, if you want to relax and feel nice and warm, you can have a <em>baño de burbajas</em> (lit: "bubble bath").</p>
