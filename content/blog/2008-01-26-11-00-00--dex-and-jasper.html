<p>Dex and Jasper are yet more Dutch people in Thailand: two old mates from back home, who are here on holiday to enjoy the beaches and to soak up the sun. They're part of my class in the <a href="/blog/padi-diving-course-begins">Open Water course</a> that I'm doing, here at <a href="/blog/bans-diving-resort-ko-tao">Ban's</a> &mdash; and they're great blokes. Quite fond of <a href="/blog/alex-and-caroline">Caroline</a>, too: but then again, who isn't? I went diving with these guys during my course; and they then went on to do the 2-day advanced course after we were finished.</p>
