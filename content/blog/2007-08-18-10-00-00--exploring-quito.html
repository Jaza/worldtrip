<p>After <a href="/blog/grand-welcome-to-quito">the all-night affair</a> that was last night, I took it nice and easy today. Got up waaay too early (like, 9:30am) so I could catch the <a href="/blog/secret-garden-quito">Secret Garden</a> laundry service, as well as their rooftop breakfast. Hey, let's face it, <em>everything</em> that happens at that place, happens on the roof. Considering my physical and mental state today, it made a perfect day for staggering around the streets of Quito, getting acquainted with a city that seemed to be just as tired and hung-over from a big Friday night as I was. That's right: nice place, but absolutely dead on a Saturday.</p>

<p>After <a href="/blog/grand-welcome-to-quito">the all-night affair</a> that was last night, I took it nice and easy today. Got up waaay too early (like, 9:30am) so I could catch the <a href="/blog/secret-garden-quito">Secret Garden</a> laundry service, as well as their rooftop breakfast. Hey, let's face it, <em>everything</em> that happens at that place, happens on the roof. Considering my physical and mental state today, it made a perfect day for staggering around the streets of Quito, getting acquainted with a city that seemed to be just as tired and hung-over from a big Friday night as I was. That's right: nice place, but absolutely dead on a Saturday.</p>
<p>I must admit, I really haven't made up my mind about whether I like Quito or hate it, and I'm not sure that I ever will. On the one hand, it has: an amazing night life and great restaurants in the Mariscal area; terrific public transportation; a very pleasant climate (I think that the cold altitude of 2,800m, and the hot latitude of 25km from the equator, cancel each other out); good places for backpackers to stay; and lots to see and do in the city and around.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it's also expensive; and (this is my biggest problem with the city) in many areas, it has a decidedly seedy, unnerving, and dangerous feel to it. The area between the Old and New Towns, in particular, has a ghost-town feel to it on weekends and at night, and it gives me bad vibes. The fact that I got harassed there this morning, by a little kid with a rusty nail, doesn't help this vibe at all (he didn't attack me, but he did half-threaten me).</p>
<p>Anyway, after my little day of exploring, I now know my way more-or-less around the Old Town (where I'm staying), the New Town (where virtually all tourist services are), and the area in between. I also got to know <em>"El Trol√©"</em>, Quito's nifty little cable-car service, which runs along two of the main roads connecting the Old and New Towns. Great service: runs every 5 minutes all day; goes fast, because it has its own lanes; and only costs $0.25 a ride (as the Americans would say, <em>"only costs a quarter"</em>).</p>
<p>All that exploring really wore me out today: so in order to catch up on last night, I slept all evening tonight (missed the Aussie BBQ dinner at the hostel &mdash; ah well, Thai curry $%#!s on that any day), and didn't get up until the next morning.</p>
