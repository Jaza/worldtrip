<p>Craig and Sarah are a friendly couple from the wonderful Aussie city of Perth. I met them last night at <a href="/blog/yoho-hostel-salzburg">Yoho</a>, where they basically arranged our big <a href="/blog/a-night-at-the-augustiner-brau">Augustiner Bräu visit</a>. Sarah's (almost) a dentist, but she's not too evil (yet). This evening, they were joined by their friend Kade &mdash; also a Perth boy, and now living in London and working as a high-school music teacher. The three of them (co-incidentally) are coming to Kitzbühel with me tomorrow, where we'll all be hitting the snow for Christmas.</p>
