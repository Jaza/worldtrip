<p>I don't know what it was that we put in our home-made pasta tonight that was bad. But whatever it was, it was <em>real</em> bad. <a href="/blog/jack-from-adelaide">Jack</a> and myself cooked up some quick pasta napolitana at <a href="/blog/loki-hostel-cusco">Loki</a> tonight, using ingredients that we'd bought at the San Pedro market. Pasta, tomatoes, packet sauce, cheese, avocado, onion, spinach, etc. A few minutes after finishing it, I felt sick. Then, later, I vomited it all right back up. Then, I had diarrhoea for two days. Talk about food poisoning. Something from that market was deadly.</p>
