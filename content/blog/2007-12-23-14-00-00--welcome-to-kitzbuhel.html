<p>Christmas in a ski village is going to be very nice and all; but it's also going to have its complications. Closure of shops will be chiefmost among them. The supermarkets here in Kitzbühel are apparently closed every Sunday &mdash; as such, we were unable to buy any groceries, or to cook dinner in the hostel, this evening. Not to worry: we treated ourselves to a nice restaurant dinner instead; and it turned out not to blow our budgets too shockingly, either. The supermarkets are also going to close at 2pm tomorrow afternoon (in preparation of Christmas eve), and they will also (of course) be closed all day on the 25<sup>th</sup> and the 26<sup>th</sup>. Could be a bit tricky: but with a bit of planning, we'll work it out.</p>
<p>One other thing about Kitzbühel: it's really cold. I've been in cold European cities non-stop for over 3 weeks now; but Kitzbühel's easily the coldest of them all. Ye 'ol thermometer's down to -10&deg;C, pretty much every evening after sunset. Seldom goes far about zero, either &mdash; even at the warmest time of the day. This is good for skiing, of course: but it does make hanging out of an evening a little unpleasant. Anyway, I guess that as long as we keep inside and stay rugged-up, it shouldn't be a problem. And the warm, thick ski parka that I've hired for the week should come in handy, too.</p>
