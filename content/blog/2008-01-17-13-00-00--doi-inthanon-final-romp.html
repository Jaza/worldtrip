<p>The third and final day of our romping through <a href="/blog/doi-inthanon-trek-begins">Doi Inthanon</a> was pleasant, mainly downhill, and all over by lunchtime. We had a relatively early start: we left the <a href="/blog/karen-hill-tribe-village">Karen village</a> at about 9:30am; and it was more jungle scenery, winding paths, and fairly easy walking for most of the morning. We were followed for some time by a few of the village dogs: the dogs around here are amiable enough to visitors; but they're bloody wild and vicious with each other! I guess that's what happens when none of them are de-sexed, and when they're all on heat 24/7. The morning rest stop was a looong and very relaxing one: we found a lovely natural pool, with a bunch of flat rocks all around, that was perfect for a &frac12; hour or so of swimming and sunbaking (and reading).</p>

<p>Excluding the break by the rock pool, the morning's walk couldn't have been more than about 2 hours. The end of the walk included the most captivating of the day's scenery: our wide dirt walking track was flanked on one side by towering bamboo plants, and on the other by a broad expanse of rice fields, which were bordered by hills and bathed by the clear sunny sky. Very classic, romantic countryside: felt like we were on a colonial safari in Imperial Siam.

<p>At the end of the walk, we found a rag-tag collection of stalls run by local people, and selling a variety of souvenirs and refreshments. There was a group of young Korean tourists sitting nearby &mdash; and it was clear that they'd provided some good business to the vendors, since they were well-equipped with water bottles and with little ornaments. One guy even set up an amusement stall, for tourists bored of waiting around: 5B for some target practice with a pellet gun and an empty Coke can. I tried my luck, but sadly marksmanship isn't one of my finer skills &mdash; I missed the can by a mile. From there, the pickup trucks returned and picked us up; and they took us over to the elephant camp, where we had a delicious restaurant lunch, and where we enjoyed a rest before the big finale of the tour.</p>
