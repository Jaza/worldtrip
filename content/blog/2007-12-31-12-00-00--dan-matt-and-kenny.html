<p>These three buddies are good blokes, and they're all staying here at <a href="/blog/cats-hostel-madrid">Cat's</a> to celebrate the New Year, <em>madrile単o</em>-style. Dan and Matt are both Aussie boys, who are of Italian heritage, and who have been living and working in Italy for the past few months. They also both have Spanish girlfriends, who they've come over here to visit. Kenny's a friend of Dan and Matt, who hasn't got a Spanish girlfriend, and who isn't an Italian Aussie &mdash; actually, he's a Brit of Spanish heritage. Complicated little groups they've got themselves into around here, don't you think? Anyway, we all had a blast this evening for <em>el A単o Nuevo</em> ("the New Year").</p>
