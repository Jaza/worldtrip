<p>Look, this place ain't the bee's knees. The rooms are packed and are abysmal; the staff couldn't give a rat's about you; and the prices aren't amazing. But hey: it's literally <em>on the beach</em>; it's surrounded by bars, restaurants, and cafés; and you're guaranteed to meet a tonne of other backpackers here. Plus, I don't believe there is any other actual dormitory accommodation around here. Oh yeah, and it has a nice pool and poolside lounge area. So go on, give <em>Sol y Mar</em> a try: everyone else has.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> I think the private rooms are OK, but the dorm is very basic indeed. Springy beds, dirt everywhere, and one cr@ppy shared bathroom.
</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> actually, most of the guests here are Peruvian families, come up from Lima for some sun, and staying in private rooms. But the <em>gringo</em> backpacker collection is nice and laid-back here as well.
</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> it's a big place, and they ain't got much time for you. But they'll give you the key, and they'll take your money.
</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> middle of everything that is "tourist Máncora". Built right on the beach, and surrounded by day- and night-life venues alike.
</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> the restaurant in the hostel is over-priced &mdash; hundreds of places next door offer similar stuff, at better value. No Internet, but (overpriced) cafés abound nearby.
</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> unreliable, don't count on it.</p>
