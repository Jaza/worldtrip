<p>Steve and I arrived and checked in to Hostal de la Niebla at the same time this evening, with me coming from Mexico City (to the west), and with Steve coming from Tampico (to the north). Since there weren't many other people at the hostel, and since we got on really well, we ended up doing pretty much everything in Xalapa together.</p>

<p>Steve's a rugged, sensible, and happy-go-lucky traveller who's been exploring the world on-and-off for about 15 years. He's been to such diverse places as North-western Australia, South Korea, and India. He strikes me as the <a href="http://sathishr.blogspot.com/2006/07/jack-reacher.html">Jack Reacher</a> type, in that he's smart and skilled in many ways, and yet he's a drifter, without any clear direction or ambition. That, and he's very tall.</p>
