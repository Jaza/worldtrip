<p>So I'm walking down 2<sup>nd</sup> Ave in New York, looking for a place to eat. And what do I see, but a store that claims (in bold letters) to sell "New York's best egg cream". So what do I do?

No &mdash; actually, I'm not a bald 50-year-old Jewish man, I'm an Aussie backpacker; so I say "I'll grab an egg cream thanks, mate".

<p><em>Egg cream drink.</em></p>
<p>An egg cream, for those of you who've never been to the Lower East Side of New York, is a delicious sort of milkshake drink. Not very thick, and a bit fizzy (I guess they put some kind of soda substance in it) &mdash; but it has plenty of milk, and it's usually mixed in with a generous serving of chocolate. But you can get other flavours of egg cream, such as banana, if you so desire.</p>

<p><em>The store that makes the big claim.</em></p>
<p>I was actually walking down this part of New York not just because I was looking for "somewhere" to eat &mdash; I was looking for <em>somewhere in particular</em>. When I last visited New York (during my USA trip with my parents, seven years ago), we ate at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Avenue_Deli">2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue Deli</a> &mdash; considered by many to be "New York's best kosher eatery" &mdash; and back then, I had the best matzah ball soup I've ever encountered in my life. Sadly, I was unable to find the deli, as it closed down about two years ago, and as there's now a bank where it used to be (cnr 2<sup>nd</sup> Ave and 10<sup>th</sup> St). Anyway, I managed to find myself a nice pastrami sandwich at another deli instead &mdash; as well as finding the egg cream &mdash; so despite the disappointment of the missing cannonball-sized <em>kneidlach</em>, I can hardly say that I missed out on "the Jewish New York eating experience".</p>
