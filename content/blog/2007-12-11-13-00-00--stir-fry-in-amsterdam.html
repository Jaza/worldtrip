<p>The Dutch are not known for their amazing cuisine. Fortunately, however, modern Amsterdam <em>is</em> known for its impressive selection of international cuisine: in particular, Asian cuisine. For lunch today, I found a great Thai noodle bar in the centre of town, that cooks up a delicious satay chicken stir-fry, served with rice and chili. Quite cheap, and absolutely delicious. There are numerous such places in the city, and they all look just as good &mdash; be sure to try one next time you're here.</p>
