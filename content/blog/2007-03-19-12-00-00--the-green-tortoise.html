<p>I found this place from the <a href="http://www.roughguides.com/">Rough Guides online accommodation directory</a>, and boy, is it <em>good</em>! Although it's surrounded by strip clubs, it's in a good downtown spot, it's got great people, it's got free dinner 3 nights a week, it's got free Wi-Fi, and it's got bike racks inside! I tell you what: there are some things you can only find in California. Despite it being rainy when I got here, I think this really is the Sunshine State.</p>

<p>The Green Tortoise is also apparently quite famous for its adventure trips, which it arranges regularly to such places as the Grand Canyon, Death Valley, and Baja California. I'm not here for the adventure, I'm here for a geek conference; but these trips sure do sound fun, so hopefully I can come back and check 'em out some day.</p>
