<p>Carlos Joel Delgado Pizarro is a young guy studying computer science at university, here in Cusco. Carlos was told about me (and vice versa) by &mdash; who else &mdash; the king of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> and of Linux-folk here in Peru: my friend <a href="/blog/antonio-ognio">Antonio Ognio</a> (from Lima). I met with Carlos today at my host family's house, and we had a good old chat about Linux, open-source, programming, the state of <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> and of open-source in Peru, and even <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> (a bit). Plus, I managed to talk with him in Spanish the whole time! Not bad, especially considering that I really wasn't feeling too good today (more food poisoning). Great guy, and a many with many questions.</p>
