<p>It was <a href="/blog/walking-in-santiago">quite awe-inspiring</a> on the first morning &mdash; after coming straight down from 5 months in PEB (Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador) &mdash; but I must admit, after 2 days in Santiago, I've had about enough of it. So last night, I said farewell to <a href="/blog/hostal-de-sammy-santiago">Sammy's</a>, and to the big city, and hopped on a bus down to Pucón. I tried out a full <em>bus cama</em> (lit: "bed bus") for the first time: it was pretty nice, although not as big a step up from <em>semi cama</em> as I was expecting (maybe I just chose a cheap company?). And now I'm in the Lake District, Chile's (and, on the other side of the mountains, Argentina's) tourism and recreational heartland. Looks divine down here.</p>

<p>Pucón's a funny little town, if ever I saw one. Although the town itself is at quite a low altitude, and doesn't have snow &mdash; even in the middle of winter &mdash; it's all varnished slate wood and rich timber signs, like an alpine ski village. Pucón is probably the biggest tourist town in Chile, and as such it's jam-packed with hotels, restaurants, and tour agencies. And, naturally, everything's way overpriced. A bit like San Pedro de Atacama, the tourist capital of the desert-dry north of Chile. Except that San Pedro ain't sitting next to a gorgeous lake, and it isn't looked over by a smoking, snow-capped volcano.
