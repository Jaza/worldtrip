<p>If you're in <em>Playa</em> on a Saturday night, <em>The Blue Parrot</em> is <em>the</em> place to go. From about 11pm onwards, this joint is pumping. Dance floor that's literally <em>on the beach</em> (about 10m from the waterline). House music, hip-hop music, and dance music ripping into the air.

<p><em>Dance floor at The Blue Parrot.</em></p>
<p>Myself, <a href="/blog/steve-and-cody">Steve, Cody</a>, and <a href="/blog/dave-from-nyc">Dave</a> went to this place on Saturday night, and we had so much fun, we came back on Sunday night, and found it still pumping as hard as ever.</p>
