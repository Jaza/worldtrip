<p>While <a href="/blog/morning-in-taquile">in Taquile this morning</a>, I went shopping in the handicraft centre there, and picked myself up some beautiful local hats. Taquile is very famous for its woollen hats, which are hand-knitted exclusively <em>by the men</em> of the island, and which are of excellent design and quality. I liked them so much, I decided to buy three! The other two will have to become presents for some people. Quite stylish, and quite protective when it comes to that harsh <em>altiplano</em> sunlight.</p>
