<p>As of tonight, my beloved little blue Nokia 3100 mobile phone is MIA (Missing In Action). I think it fell out of my pocket, when I got out of a taxi this evening. Very sad, and very much a pain in the a$$: people have been calling me (and vice versa) on it every day while I've been in Cusco, and would have continued doing so for the remainder of my time here, were my phone not lost. I've already tried calling and SMSing it numerous times, but so far, with no response. I still have hopes of recovering it, but the chances of that happening around here are pretty slim. Looks like I might have to say goodbye to my phone, and move on.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's not the end of the world: things certainly could have been worse. Firstly, the phone only had a local pre-paid SIM card in it (with about USD$5 of credit), which would have been pretty useless to me outside of Peru anyway; and I won't be in Peru for that much longer. My Australian SIM card is safe and sound back home, awaiting my return. And secondly, the phone itself is about 3 years old by now, and isn't worth that much money. I would have been a lot more pi$$ed off if, for example, I'd lost my camera (along with whatever photos on it were yet to be backed up) &mdash; something that's already happened to a lot of people I've met, but that thankfully hasn't happened to me as yet.</p>
