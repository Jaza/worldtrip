<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerschlagen">Hammerschlagen</a> is a game with a simple set of rules, and a very difficult gameplay. In this centuries-old German / Austrian social game, you have a tree stump (with its surface flattened and smoothed), you have a hammer, and you have a bunch of nails. Each player takes a nail, and hammers their nail a few millimetres into the stump. Then &mdash; using <em>only</em> the thin, axe-like side of the hammer &mdash; each player in turn attempts to whack their nail all the way in. For this evening's <em>après-ski</em> in Kitzbühel, we kicked off the night with a visit to Chizzo (an outdoor bar in the main street of town), where they have a Hammerschlagen area set up. <a href="/blog/jake-and-mitch">Jake and Mitch</a> introduced the rest of us to the game: here in Kitzbühel, the rule is that the loser (the last person to hammer their nail in) shouts a shot of <a href="/blog/jagermeister">Jäger</a> to everyone else who played. Check out the video.</p>

<p><em>Hammerschlagen in Kitzbühel.</em></p>

<p><em>Little kids having a whack: you're meant to use the other side of the hammer.</em></p>
<p>I have a few pieces of advice for anyone who wants to play Hammerschlagen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't play if you're broke.</strong> When we played this evening, we ended up getting about 7 people in a single game. The loser (fortunately not myself) had to shout over €20 worth of Jäger shots!</li>
<li><strong>Don't play against the barman.</strong> Woody is the barman at Chizzo, and he's a Hammerschlagen prodigy: one hit, and he gets it all the way in, every single time.</li>
<li><strong>Don't play against the people that taught you.</strong> Jake and Mitch are pretty savvy at the ol' Hammerschlagen, too.</li>
<li><strong>Don't lose hope.</strong> Just because you've missed the nail the previous 20 turns, doesn't mean you won't pulverise it spot-on during your next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Just whack it.</strong> This is the most important piece of advice I can give you! The truth is that whether you tap like a girl ("carefully" &mdash; or at least attempting to be) or you whack like Hercules, you have the same (un)likelihood of actually hitting the nail. So you might as well give it all you got: then, at least, when you finally do hit it, you'll get it all the way in (or close to it) in one shot.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>After the game: free Jäger shots for all!</em></p>
<p>Other than that, all I can say is: enjoy yourself, take it easy, and keep them Jägers coming!</p>
