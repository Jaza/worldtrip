<p>When I met John and Matt, back at <a href="http://www.oscms-summit.org/">DrupalCon Sunnyvale</a> in March, they were still in the final stages of writing <a href="http://www.drupalbook.com/">Pro Drupal Development</a>. But now it's out. And there's no doubt at all: this is <em>the</em> book on <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. It's so good, it even scored a <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/06/1352210">Slashdot review</a> (and that's no small feat). This book really does have everything the professional Drupal developer needs to know. Pereonally, I like the final chapters most (on security and performance), and I'm confident that they'll be a reference asset to me for years to come. Got the book today in Boston, as it will undoubtedly be more expensive back home than it is here in the USA.</p>
