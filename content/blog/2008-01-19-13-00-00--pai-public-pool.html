<p>We were a bit hot and worn-out from our <a href="/blog/first-ever-motorbike-ride">wicked motorbike ride</a>; so this afternoon, <a href="/blog/marie-and-claire">Marie, Claire</a> and myself cooled off by taking a dip in the Pai public pool. The pool is located up on the eastern hillside overlooking the Pai valley, and it's run by a kind old Thai couple. We met a few other people at the pool, and we splashed around for a bit; but mostly, we just ended up relaxing in the large deck chairs, enjoying the gorgeous view (and the divine sunset), sipping <a href="/blog/return-of-the-fresh-juice">fresh juice</a>, and playing cards. Life sure is strenuous here in Thailand... I don't know how much more of this I can handle :P.</p>
