<p>Since I <a href="/blog/hampy-site-4-nights-in-and-looking-good">last reported on the status</a> of the new <a href="http://hampy.org/">Hampy web site</a>, there has been a lot of progress. I've been working on the site pretty much every day over the past week (apart from my <a href="/blog/apurimac-rafting-trip-the-finale">three days of rafting</a>), and the site is basically functioning, set up, and ready to go. However, more work is needed (particularly in the area of custom templating) before it's 100% good to launch. So it looks like I'll be hanging around for at least a few days after my jungle trip next week, to finish off the loose ends for the site.</p>
