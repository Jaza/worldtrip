<p>According to what I was told, it's generally fairly obvious when Peruvian money is fake. In the case of coins, you need to look out for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal that has a slightly off colour or feel</li>
<li>Text that's the wrong size or poorly formed</li>
<li>Engraved symbols and pictures that are incorrectly placed, or that are too deeply or too shallowly engraved</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, after offering the <em>falso</em> to about 10 different people, and having it rejected, I managed to flog it off the next day, at a <em>cabina</em>. Lucky I managed to get rid of it, and lucky it was only s/1 (app. USD$0.30).
</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> the <em>falso</em> is the one <em>a la izquierda</em> (<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">use Babelfish</a> to help you find the answer, if you really need to know, and if you don't know any Spanish).</p>
