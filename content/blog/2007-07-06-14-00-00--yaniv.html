<p>For the past few days, myself, <a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a>, <a href="/blog/leila-and-christina">Leila and Christina</a> have been playing a card game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaniv_(card_game)">Yaniv</a> quite a lot. Leila and Christina learned it from some Israelis a few months back (it's an Israeli-invented game &mdash; hence the name). It's quite a fun game, although Chris and I seem to lose at it most of the time. Great way to pass the time, and always good to learn new card games.</p>
