<p><a href="http://www.ellenskitchen.com/recipebox/sticky.html">Sweet sticky rice</a> is a delicious dessert in Thai cuisine. The art of making sticky rice is quite an involved one: it includes soaking the rice (special-grain) in water overnight, and then cooking it in a special steamer and bag. For the sweet sticky rice dish, you add sugar and coconut, and the rice is generally served with fresh mango slices. Sweet sticky rice was the final dish that we made during <a href="/blog/cooking-in-chiang-mai">today's cooking class</a>: and by the time we got round to sampling it, we were already all in imminent danger of explosion, due to overeating.</p>

<p><em>The traditional way to eat sticky rice is to roll it into a ball with your hands, to dip the ball into a bowl of sauce, and to pop the sticky ball in your mouth.</em></p>
