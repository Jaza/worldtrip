<p>The <a href="http://www.herberge-dresden.de/">Herberge der Jugend, Dresden</a> is an absolute last-resort accommodation option: I only stayed here tonight because <em>every single other hostel in Dresden</em> was full; don't consider staying here unless you're faced with a similarly dire predicament. It's a nice enough place: but it's more than &frac12; an hour from the city centre, and it's completely dead. Dresden has plenty of better hostels: do yourself a favour, book one of the others... and make your booking well in advance!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.herberge-dresden.de/">Herberge der Jugend, Dresden</a> is an absolute last-resort accommodation option: I only stayed here tonight because <em>every single other hostel in Dresden</em> was full; don't consider staying here unless you're faced with a similarly dire predicament. It's a nice enough place: but it's more than &frac12; an hour from the city centre, and it's completely dead.

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> nice, and you'll get one all to yourself (for less than a crowded dorm elsewhere); although a bit cold at night.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> huh?</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> only available at very limited times; although friendly and helpful when they're around.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> fricking miles away from anywhere; although it is, at least, (fortunately) quite close to a regular tram service, that goes straight into the city centre.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> none provided; but the guest kitchen is pretty god.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> I think they're meant to charge you for it (they have a system where you shove tokens into a machine, in order to power the 2 PCs in the lobby), but the staff insist on giving you the tokens for free. Nice perk!</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> didn't try it &mdash; probably good.</p>
