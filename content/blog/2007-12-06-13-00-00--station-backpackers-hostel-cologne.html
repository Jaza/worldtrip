<p>The <a href="http://www.hostel-cologne.de/">Station Backpacker's</a> is a reasonable enough place: big, full of party spirit, and right in the heart of fun-packed Cologne. My biggest gripe is that the hostel has too many levels, and too many winding stairs to take you up to them: you kind of end up racing up and down them a lot. Otherwise, it's a well laid-out affair, with good staff and even better fellow guests. As with yesterday's <a href="/blog/black-forest-hostel-freiburg">hostel in Freiburg</a>, it's just a pity that I can't stay here longer &mdash; but my schedule is rather hectic at the moment.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hostel-cologne.de/">Station Backpacker's</a> is a reasonable enough place: big, full of party spirit, and right in the heart of fun-packed Cologne. My biggest gripe is that the hostel has too many levels, and too many winding stairs to take you up to them: you kind of end up racing up and down them a lot. Otherwise, it's a well laid-out affair, with good staff and even better fellow guests. As with yesterday's <a href="/blog/black-forest-hostel-freiburg">hostel in Freiburg</a>, it's just a pity that I can't stay here longer &mdash; but my schedule is rather hectic at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> comfortable, quiet, and very secure &mdash; except there's so many of them, you can get lost looking for yours.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> Cologne's a party city, and the guests at this place are looking for as much of the action as they can find.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> not the most helpful bunch, but they do their job, and they speak good English.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> as the name suggests, it's one block from the train station &mdash; but also an easy walk from the historic centre and all the nightlife of Cologne.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> breakfast isn't free, but is extremely cheap and pretty good. There's also a good guest kitchen available.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 3 PCs, available for free use &mdash; excellent deal; just watch out for the PC on the left, it's too slow and crap to actually use.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> didn't get a chance to test it out.</p>
