<p>For this morning's ride, I left my <a href="/blog/a-field-near-gangi">field near Gangi</a> bright and early, and rode west through the town of Gangi, continuing on until I reached the turnoff north into the Madonie mountains. From here, it was only a short ride to the mountain town of Geraci Siculo, where I found a lovely (albeit mostly ruined) hilltop <em>castello</em> ("castle") to explore. It was a tough ride to Geraci Siculo &mdash; the weather turned quite cold, and it got a bit rainy, plus there were quite a few minor uphill sections &mdash; but when I got there, I was rewarded with great scenic views, a quaint village atmosphere, and a bar that served an excellent <a href="/blog/cioccolata-calda">hot chocolate</a> for the morning break. Plus, after reaching the town, the weather improved, and it was all downhill riding.</p>

<p><em>Hilltop castle ruins at Geraci Siculo.</em></p>
<p>The castle at Geraci Siculo is quite old &mdash; about 1,000 years old, I think &mdash; and although there's not much left of it, the ruins are well-preserved, and the panorama from the top is still fabulous. Since I had plenty of time this morning, I decided to tie up my bike at the bottom of the hill, and to hike up to the castle on foot. There's a road that goes all the way up: but I chose to take a shortcut, and to scramble up a steep trail that goes straight up the hillside. Not sure if I was meant to do this &mdash; not sure if the ruins were open at all, really, as the main gate seemed to be locked &mdash; but there was nobody around to care, anyway. It was good fun getting to the top; and I had a nice time exploring the castle remains once I'd finished the climb.</p>
