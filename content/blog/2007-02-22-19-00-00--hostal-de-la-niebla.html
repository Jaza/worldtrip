<p>This is a great little place to stay in Xalapa, although it was very quiet and empty, which is apparently how it is most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> nice and clean.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> not many, but those that are there are great &mdash; some are a bit rugged.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> nice, but non-English-speaking.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> middle of town, a short walk from everything.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> simple, free breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> free for 15 mins (only 1 PC).</p>
