<p>By the time I made it to the resort-ified coast south of Marsala this afternoon, it was getting late, and daylight was in scarce supply. This would have worried me, except that the weather was fine and warm; and the low west-coast horizon of the sea kept things light-ish for longer than usual. I found plenty of signs directing me to a proper campsite in the area: but these signs turned out to be incredibly inaccurate and confusing; and by the time I finally found the campsite (after riding around lost for ages), it was thoroughly shut down for the season anyway. What is it with Sicily in November, and <a href="/blog/camping-bazia">shut campsites</a>? Apparently, there are so few of them, that it's barely worth bothering to even try camping legally around here (and if you're not in a campsite, it's not legal). So I found an empty field a few streets away, and pitched ye 'ol tent there instead.</p>

<p>Tonight's camping was the most pleasant I've done so far. The field that I found was clearly vacant: it had a building under construction just next to it; a string of planted palm trees (arguably a mini-forest) behind it; and a few houses and resorts across the road from it. Plus, it was only about 50m from the beach and the sea, and it was a warm clear night. Nice, soft flat grass for my tent; calm wind for cooking and sleeping in; and a gorgeous, starry Mediterranean sky to bedazzle me overhead.</p>
