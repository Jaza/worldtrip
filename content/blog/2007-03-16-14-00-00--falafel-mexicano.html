<p>I only had it so I could say: <em>"I went to Mexico, and I ate a falafel"</em>. There, see, I said it :P. But actually, the falafel in the small, Israeli-run shop in downtown San Cristóbal was one of the best meals I've had in a while, and it was possibly the best falafel I've had in my whole life. Fresh pita pockets, hommus mixed with oil and whole chick peas, coleslaw salad on the side, and sauces of <em>salsa verde</em> and <em>salsa rojo</em>. Mmm... <em>¡sabbaba, amigo!</em></p>
