<p><em><a href="http://www.dict.cc/german-english/gem%FCtliche.html">Gemütliche</a></em> is a very special word indeed. So special, in fact, that despite its not being Spanish, it calls for a one-time revival of the famous <em>Palabra Del Día</em> (lit: "Word of the Day") tradition, that I bet you thought was long-finished on this blog. <em>Gemütliche</em> means "cosy". It means comfortable. It means warm and fuzzy and cute &mdash; and all in that distinctive, Germanic, central European way that can't be found elsewhere in this world. I've heard the word <em>gemütliche</em> used many times, here in Kitzbühel; and I'm not surprised by this at all. Kitzbühel is possibly about as <em>gemütliche</em> a place as you could ever find: small, proud, beautiful and cosy; and extremely Austrian. And like so many other highly expressive German words, <em>gemütliche</em> also found its way firmly into the Yiddish language, and subsequently into modern Yiddish-peppered American English &mdash; which is why I've known it for as long as I can remember.</p>
