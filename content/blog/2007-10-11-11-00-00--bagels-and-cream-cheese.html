<p>The perfect Jewish American breakfast. And since I got in to Boston, I seem to have had it almost every morning &mdash; mainly because <a href="/blog/tara-and-ashki">Tara and Ashki</a> don't have that much else lying around the kitchen, in the way of breakfast foods. I can't say I don't like it &mdash; it's quite delicious &mdash; but then again, I'd prefer something a little more like what I'm used to. We'll have to stock up on some cereal soon. In the meantime, <em>it doesn't hoyt.</em></p>

<p>The perfect Jewish American breakfast.

<p>Also, speaking of food, and speaking of Tara and Ashki: I gave them some of the <a href="/blog/helena-chocolates">Peruvian chocolates</a>, as a little gift; and they went down very well. I don't think Ashki got any &mdash; Tara saw them, and 5 minutes later they'd magically disappeared &mdash; but they were certainly popular. And rightly so, too: <em>Â¡son muy, muy ricos!</em></p>
