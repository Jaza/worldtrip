<p>After we'd wolfed down some bagels and cream cheese for breakfast, at <a href="/blog/tara-and-ashki">Tara and Ashki</a>'s place, we headed out into the centre of town, on Boston's "T" train system. We got off at Boston Common, which is a nice big park in the historic area of the city. Right next to the Common is the Massachusetts State House: you can go inside here and squiz around the place for free, which we did

<p>We went to a post office in town, where I managed to send <a href="/blog/postal-woes-in-new-york">my postcard from New York</a> (dad sent a postcard as well), without quite having to wait in line until the next ice age. Plus, we wandered around such central areas as Fanueil Hall, Quincy Market, and the waterfront docks, catching up on things and enjoying the scenery.

<p>I got dad back to the <a href="/blog/the-goldstein-bempechat-clan">Goldsteins'</a> house, in time for him to have his reunion with the cousins, before he went home and crashed soundly.</p>
