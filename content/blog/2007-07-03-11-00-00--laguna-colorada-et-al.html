<p>Yesterday, we <a href="/blog/salty-morning">did the actual salt flats</a> of the Salar de Uyuni. Today, we were done with the salt flats, and what we saw at each stop of the 4x4 was <em>lagunas</em>, <em>lagunas</em>, and more <em>lagunas</em> (lit: "lagoons"). We saw <em>Laguna Colorada</em> (lit: "colourful lagoon" &mdash; so called for its striking red, blue, white, and grey colours), as well as various other <em>lagunas</em>, most of which I can't remember the name. Also saw lots of cool pink <em>flamencos</em> (lit: "flamingos") in the <em>lagunas</em>, and a tonne of <em>vicuña</em> (small furry animals, kind of like something in-between a llama and a deer). Spectacular scenery all the way.</p>
