<p>Lunch today was my last meal before the 25-hour fast of <em>Yom Kippur</em> (the holiest day in the Jewish year) &mdash; therefore, as far as quantity went, I wasn't playing around. This afternoon, <a href="/blog/oly-the-brit">Oly</a> and I went to a great restaurant in San Telmo, called <em>Desnivel</em>, where I ordered a <em>bife de chorizo mariposa</em> (butterfly T-bone steak) that was bigger than me. Had to have been the largest piece of meat I've eaten in my life. Getting through the fast this year is going to be no problem at all :P.</p>
