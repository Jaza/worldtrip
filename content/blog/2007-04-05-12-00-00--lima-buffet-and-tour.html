<p>Today, I finally met my Lima-based friend <a href="/blog/antonio-ognio">Antonio Ognio</a>, the king of all Peruvian Linux geeks. As an introduction to his home city, Antonio suggested that he take me to a nearby all-you-can-eat buffet &mdash; serving a wide variety of popular local dishes &mdash; and that he give me a small walking tour of Lima. Turned out to be a great day.
</p>
<p>I met up with Antonio in central Miraflores, just outside Parque Kennedy, and then we caught a <em>combi</em> a bit further north. Up until this point, I'd only caught the <em>combis</em> that go up and down Av. Arequipa, between downtown Lima and Miraflores. But the <em>combi</em> network is much more vast and complicated than that: you can use it to get virtually anywhere in Lima.
</p>
<p>We had lunch at an all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant. Great deal, but make sure you bring a big appetite. They have three main types of cuisine at this place:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Traditional Andean food, which has a lot of corn, rice, and creamy bean-based sauces;</li>
<li><em>"Chifa"</em>, or Peruvian Chinese food, which is essentially just a basic subset of regular Chinese cuisine;</li>
<li><em>"Ceviche"</em>, or seafood.</li>
</ol>
<p>I managed to get through 2 full plates &mdash; one of Andean food, and one of <em>chifa</em> &mdash; but I couldn't finish my <em>ceviche</em> plate, due to both being full, and to my lack of preference for seafood. But all the food was delicious, and I left having more food in my stomach than I previously believed it was possible to fit inside.

<p>We continued the afternoon with a small tour of Miraflores. Antonio showed me one of the archaeological sites inside the city of Lima &mdash; this one was some sort of pyramid-like structure, built of adobe bricks, and half-buried by a mound of rubble. We didn't go inside, but we could see a fair bit from the street.
</p>
<p>We also had some fantastic ice-cream, at a little <em>heladeria</em> in Miraflores. To finish off the tour, we went to the Inca market, and perused some of the fine Alpaca garments, and other (massively overpriced) souvenirs on display.</p>
