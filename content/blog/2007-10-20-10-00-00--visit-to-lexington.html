<p>We had a relaxed but really enjoyable day today. Although it was Saturday, most of the <a href="/blog/the-goldstein-bempechat-clan">Goldsteins</a> were (sadly) busy: Adam and David were off at a golf tourmanent; and Becca was (for a change) working like crazy all day. So it was just my <a href="/blog/dad">dad</a>, Janine, and myself. Janine drove us over to the town of Lexington, which is about &frac12; an hour west of Newton (it's almost part of Boston, but not quite), and which is one of the great historic Massachusetts towns from the 18<sup>th</sup> century War of Independence. Charming place, and filled with monuments from centuries past.</p>

Janine drove us over to the town of Lexington, which is about &frac12; an hour west of Newton (it's almost part of Boston, but not quite), and which is one of the great historic Massachusetts towns from the 18<sup>th</sup> century War of Independence. Charming place, and filled with monuments from centuries past.</p>
<p>The main attraction that we covered, in Lexington, was the Buckman Tavern. They do a tour of this tavern every half-hour, with a guide who's dressed up in an authentic period outfit, and who knows the history of the place better than he knows his wife's birthday. The Buckman Tavern was one of the "strong houses" for the American Independence fighters, and many famous people &mdash; including Paul Revere, and George Washington himself &mdash; are known to have enjoyed a pint and a night's sleep within its humble walls. Although the house has been restored somewhat, and although they do go to painful efforts in order to preserve it, most of it is true-blue 300-year-old wood and stone.</p>
<p>They have some quirky little things on display in the house. The 17<sup>th</sup> century beds are quite alarming: apparently, back then they slept directly on the ropes that were netted to the frame, instead of putting a mattress on top! This is ostensibly the origin of the English phrase: "sleep tight". They also have very old cooking instruments, and a great big wood-fire oven that they would have once been used in. Plus, the oldest piece of furniture in the house is a 300-year-old wooden chair, that George Washington is believed to have sat in during one of his visits to the house.</p>
<p>Lexington is a quaint little town: and although it's in danger of becoming a suburb of Boston, it still definitely looks and feels like a colonial village. The memorial squares and statues are in pristine shape, and the tree-lined avenues are quite austere. The incredible weather that we had today, combined with the gorgeous New England Fall at this time of year, only made the place all the more attractive.</p>
