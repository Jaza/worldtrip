<p>Lovely couple from Seattle, USA, that came with us on our <a href="/blog/into-the-canon-del-colca">three-day hike in the Cañon del Colca</a>. Sarah's a nurse for psychiatric people, and Dan's an <abbr title="English as a Second Language</abbr> teacher (also a qualified Spanish teacher &mdash; he spent many years living in Central and South America). Dan also has a massive patch over his left eye, which he lost to cancer a few years back. These people were good fun to take hiking, and to share a few beers with.</p>
