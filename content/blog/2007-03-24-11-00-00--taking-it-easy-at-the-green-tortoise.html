<p>Wasn't feeling too good today. Crap in my throat, could barely talk, and quite tired. Must have been the oversupply of meeting and greeting and drinking, and the shortage of sleep, that I experienced over the past two days at <a href="/tags/drupalcon">DrupalCon</a>. The weather was also rather unspectacular today. So I just took it easy at the <a href="/blog/the-green-tortoise">Green Tortoise</a> here in SF, drank lots of tea, and spent most of the day using the free Wi-Fi here to update this blog.</p>
