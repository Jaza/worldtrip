<p>Issac was the guy who took me up the crazy <a href="/blog/climbing-huayna-potosi">climb of Huayna Potosí</a> this weekend. He's an incredibly fit and ready-for-anything guide: he climbs the mountain as much as three times each week; and he knows it like the back of his hand. Couldn't have got to the top without him.</p>
