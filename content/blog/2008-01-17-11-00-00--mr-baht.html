<p>As well as the smiling, joking <a href="/blog/cluck">*Cluck"</a> &mdash; whose favourite sayings are "oh my Buddha" (ostensibly because they believe in Buddha, not G-d), and "no money no honey" &mdash; we also have another guide on <a href="/blog/doi-inthanon-trek-begins">this trek</a>. I don't know his real name, but I call him "Mr. Baht". He's the accountant of the tour. He enjoys telling us repeatedly, and well in advance, whenever there's an additional cost coming our way, and exactly what the amount will be. And he takes great pride in keeping a drinks tab for all of us, every night, and in meticulously tracking our purchases and in chasing down our money every morning. Mr. Baht like his money.</p>
