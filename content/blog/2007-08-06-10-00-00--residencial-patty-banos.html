<p>It's rather lacking in hot water, plush rooms, or any other bells and whistles. But Patty is cheap, it's always got space, and it's right in the middle of everything. Unfortunately, no dorms &mdash; just rooms with 2 or 3 beds &mdash; but that's OK if you've got someone to share the crash pad with, and for this week I'm crashing with <a href="/blog/patrick-the-belgian">Patrick</a>. If it's a really busy week, if you're feeling a bit tight for money, or if you're just not too fussed about where you stay, then Patty is the place to go.</p>

<p>It's rather lacking in hot water, plush rooms, or any other bells and whistles. But Patty is cheap, it's always got space, and it's right in the middle of everything. Unfortunately, no dorms &mdash; just rooms with 2 or 3 beds &mdash; but that's OK if you've got someone to share the crash pad with, and for this week I'm crashing with <a href="/blog/patrick-the-belgian">Patrick</a>. If it's a really busy week, if you're feeling a bit tight for money, or if you're just not too fussed about where you stay, then Patty is the place to go.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> basic, and a bit cold, but they do the job.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> generally pretty empty, but there are always at least a few other budget travellers hanging around.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> they don't go out of their way for you, but they're nice enough, and they'll open the front door no matter how late you come back from the pub.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "bar street" &mdash; the place is in the middle of town, and it's on the street with every bar, club, and disco in Baños (of which there are quite a few). So don't expect to get a quiet, early night's sleep here.</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> none.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> don't count on it. I scored one hot shower in my week here &mdash; the rest were as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Truth">cold as the Keeper's heart</a>.</p>
