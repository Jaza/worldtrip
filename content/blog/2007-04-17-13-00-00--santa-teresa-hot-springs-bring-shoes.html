<p>I really am having bad luck with the old shoe department today. First there was the incident with the wet money; and then I had this: declining to bring shoes &mdash; or footwear of any kind &mdash; when I really, really should have done otherwise. The hot springs of Santa Teresa are absolutely divine; but when they assure you that you're getting a lift all the way there, don't count on it. You never know when you might need a bit of footwear.</p>

<p>I really am having bad luck with the old shoe department today. First there was the incident with the wet money; and then I had this: declining to bring shoes &mdash; or footwear of any kind &mdash; when I really, really should have done otherwise. The hot springs of Santa Teresa are absolutely divine; but when they assure you that you're getting a lift all the way there, don't count on it. You never know when you might need a bit of footwear.</p>
<p>After we arrived in Santa Teresa this afternoon, and set up camp, we had the opportunity to take another ride in the truck &mdash; this time in the natural hot springs just outside the town. Most people were keen to try out the springs, myself included. Most people also brought shoes and / or flip-flops. Myself not included.</p>
<p>So we get in the truck, and we drive down to the hot springs. Well, what do you know: about &frac34; of the way there, the road turns to mud, and the driver refuses to take us further. So we have to walk the rest of the way &mdash; a few hundred metres of half-muddy, half-rocky road.</p>
<p><em>"Aaargh! Why the %&amp;$ didn't I bring any shoes?"</em></p>
<p>Anyway, I would have been totally screwed, were it not for the generosity of the Swiss girl Sarah (in the group adjacent to ours), who lent me her flip-flops &mdash; which she brought as well as her shoes &mdash; so that I could make the distance. I had to take them off and to walk barefoot in the muddy bits (or they'd stick in the mud); but for the rest, they saved my soles (no pun intended) on the way there and back.</p>
<p>Anyway, shoes aside, the hot springs were utterly divine, and they were exactly what we needed in order to rest our aching muscles. The water must have been at least 40&deg;C, and I must say, a hot bath never felt so good. The combination of the heat, and the various minerals in the water, resulted in those poor old muscles getting soothed and hydrated.</p>
<p>The springs are enclosed in a man-made pool, but the water and the heat is all-natural. And even at night, with an unlit and too-muddy-to-drive-on road being the only access, the springs were quite crowded as well. There were a few other groups of tourists in the pool with us, as well as a few locals. I can understand the popularity: I highly recommend a visit to your nearby hot springs, after or during your next long hike, wherever it may be.</p>
