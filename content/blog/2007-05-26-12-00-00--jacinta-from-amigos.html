<p>Jacinta is a wild and crazy girl (in her early 30s) from the dear town of Bendigo, Australia. I met her tonight at <a href="/blog/happy-birthday-jesus">Jesus's birthday party</a>; she's known Jesus for about 7 years, since she first came to Cusco and got taught Spanish by him. In her time, she's worked as a ceramics maker and as an international tour guide (among other things). But now, she's having a break from all that, and she's returned to Cusco to help out with whatever she can at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>. Oh, and did I mention that her singing and dancing gets more out of control with each beer she consumes?</p>
