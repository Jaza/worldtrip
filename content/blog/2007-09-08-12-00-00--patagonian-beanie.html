<p>This big, furry, Russian-style <em>gorro</em> (lit: "beanie") was purchased this morning, due to my previous beanie's whereabouts being unknown. I tried it on the slopes today, for <a href="/blog/catedral-snowboarding-final-day">my final day of snowboarding</a>, and I can attest that it is <em>very</em> warm. Quite stylish, as well. The emblem on the front reads: "Patagonia Argentina" (Patagonia is the name of the region encompassing southern and Andean Argentina).</p>
