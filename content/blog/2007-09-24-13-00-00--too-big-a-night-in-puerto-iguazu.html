<p>This evening at the <a href="/blog/hostel-inn-puerto-iguazu">Hostel Inn</a>, I stuffed myself silly on the delicious all-you-can-eat BBQ dinner, I slurped away on the giant bucket of serve-yourself <em>capirinha</em> (after all, this is almost Brazil here), plus I enjoyed the great Tango show that they put on after the meal. Since I booked a tour to the falls for 9am tomorrow, that should have been all I did for the night. But I was silly enough to convince myself that I was being told the truth, when an Irish guy suggested that we go into town for "a few quick drinks". Hah: Irish &mdash; drinks &mdash; "a few" &mdash; "quick" &mdash; who was I kidding?! Anyway, I can't say it wasn't fun, staying out at the pubs of Puerto Iguazú until 4am; but as for tomorrow morning &mdash; that was Not Very Fun At All&trade;.</p>
