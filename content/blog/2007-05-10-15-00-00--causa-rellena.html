<p>A gourmet dish of spicy mashed potatoes and shredded chicken, garnished with egg and vegetables, <em>causa rellena</em> makes for a great meal or afternoon snack. This afternoon, for my third weekly cooking lesson at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>, the acclaimed chef Ricardo (of <a href="/blog/tiradito-de-pescado"><em>tiradito de pescado</em></a> fame) showed a small group of us how to prepare <em>causa rellena</em>. He did most of the cooking, we did most of the eating. Here's how you do it.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1kg <em>papa amarilla</em> ("yellow potato" &mdash; if unavailable outside Peru, find the nicest potatoes you can in your area)</li>
<li>Vegetable oil</li>
<li>4 small chilis (2 <em>ajis amarillos</em>, or "yellow chilis", and 2 <em>rocotos</em>, or "red chilis")</li>
<li>3 limes</li>
<li>1 chicken breast fillet</li>
<li>1 tspn mayonnaise</li>
<li>5 celery sticks</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 avocado</li>
<li>1 bunch fresh parsley</li>
<li>4 black olives</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wash the potatoes, and boil until cooked (don't peel yet).</li>
<li>Slice the chilis in half, and remove the seeds from the inside (dispose of seeds).</li>
<li>Cut the fat off the chicken breast, and boil the chicken until cooked.</li>
<li>Boil the chilis until soft.</li>
<li>Wash the celery, peel off the outer skin, and finely chop.</li>
<li>Take chilis off the stove, drain, and peel off skin.</li>
<li>Take potatoes off the stove, drain, and pull off skin while still hot.</li>
<li>Mash the potatoes.</li>
<li>Blend the chilis (<em>ajis amarillos</em>) with a splash of vegetable oil. Then blend the other chilis (<em>rocotos</em>) separately, also with oil.</li>
<li>Shred (i.e. tear apart) the boiled chicken breast.</li>
<li>Hard-boil the eggs until cooked.</li>
<li>Put the mash in two bowls (&frac12; in each). Mix the <em>rocoto</em> paste, the <em>aji amarillo</em> paste into the other. Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to both bowls, and mix thoroughly.</li>
<li>Mix the shredded chicken, celery, mayonnaise, and some more salt and pepper in a big bowl.</li>
<li>With each olive, cut the olive off from the seed, and finely slice.</li>
<li>Peel skin off avocado, and chop most of the avocado into small pieces (chop some into bigger slices).</li>
<li>Wash and finely chop the parsley.</li>
<li>Take off the eggs, and peel off the shells.</li>
<li>In a medium-sized, shallow container, place <em>rocoto</em> / potato mix, chicken mix, avocado and <em>aji amarillo</em> / potato mix in layers, and empty out onto the plate in a mound.</li>
<li>Garnish with chopped egg, olive, parsley, and avocado.</li>
<li>Resistence is futile. You know you gotta eat it without delay.</li>
</ol>
