<p>I spent the second day of <em>Rosh Hashanah</em> much as I <a href="/blog/rosh-hashanah-celebrations-day-1">did the first</a>: that is, praying and eating (and plenty of both) at "Chabad La Metayel", here in downtown Buenos Aires. We did a lot better with getting a <em>minyan</em> this morning, which was good: the service had already started when I arrived; and we had time to do it properly, with all the singing and the joy that really (in my opinion) makes a <em>shul</em> service special. And as with yesterday, we had plenty of <em>shofar</em> sounding interspersed throughout the prayers; and a long and cosy (and totally over-catered) lunch in the afternoon.</p>

<p>I spent the second day of <em>Rosh Hashanah</em> much as I <a href="/blog/rosh-hashanah-celebrations-day-1">did the first</a>: that is, praying and eating (and plenty of both) at "Chabad La Metayel", here in downtown Buenos Aires. We did a lot better with getting a <em>minyan</em> this morning, which was good: the service had already started when I arrived; and we had time to do it properly, with all the singing and the joy that really (in my opinion) makes a <em>shul</em> service special. And as with yesterday, we had plenty of <em>shofar</em> sounding interspersed throughout the prayers; and a long and cosy (and totally over-catered) lunch in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Following the second-day lunch, we had an afternoon break, during which I walked back to <a href="/blog/hostel-clan-ba">The Clan</a> for a <em>siesta</em>. All that eating and praying is hard work &mdash; no, really, I was buggered, and I slept all afternoon! However, I came back to <em>shul</em> at about 8pm &mdash; by this time, the two days that constitute <em>Rosh Hashanah</em> had officially finished; but this being Friday night, they'd immediately given way to <em>Erev Shabbat</em>. So we had a Shabbat evening service (quite a good turnout &mdash; lots of fresh Israeli faces), followed by yet another massive, chicken-filled, <em>glat kosher</em> meal. More eating, more singing, more Hebrew.</p>
<p>I'm now completely "shuled out": I need a week to recover from it all, until we hit <em>Yom Kippur</em>. But it's been a really incredible way to spend the New Year, and I'm very grateful to the people that have made it possible.</p>
