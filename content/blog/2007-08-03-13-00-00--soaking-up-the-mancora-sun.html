<p>What can I say, except <em>"the beach: it's good to be back"</em>? :P</p>
<p>I made the most of my first day at the beach, after four beachless months in South America, in the best way possible. By doing not very much. Read a book. Met some girls. Swam in the ocean. Sunbaked all afternoon. Ate a mountain of delicious <em>ceviche</em> (raw seafood, soaked in lemon juice &mdash; you can find it every 5 metres or so, here in Máncora). Slept a bit. As we say back home (and by "we", I have no idea who I'm referring to &mdash; probably very few people), I <em>chillaxed</em>. Perfect way to end my time in Peru. Stuff the mountains. I'm sitting on the beach this weekend.</p>
