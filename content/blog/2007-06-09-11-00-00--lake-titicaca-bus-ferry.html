<p>During our bus journey from Copacabana to La Paz this morning (after first <a href="/blog/first-bolivian-bus-booking">buying our tickets</a>), we had to cross over Lake Titicaca at one point, where the lake is very narrow, and where you'd otherwise have to drive around for a very long way. They have a pretty cool ferry system at this spot, where they ferry cars &mash; and buses! &mdash; across on wooden rafts. They also ferry people across, on little motor-boats. Fun little interruption to an otherwise eventless journey.</p>

<p>When we reached the ferry spot, we all had to get off the bus, and catch a motor-boat across the water, while the bus got put on its own ferry-raft and taken across. Then, on the other side, we had to wait a bit, and hope that the raft hadn't cracked and taken the bus down with it (along with all our bags!). But it was all good.

<p>They also have a naval base here on the lake, where the proud "Bolivian navy" is stationed. A bit of a joke, because Bolivia doesn't actually have any coastline on the sea &mdash; at least, not since Chile stole it off them about a century ago &mdash; and yet they insist on still having a navy on all the lakes and rivers within their territory. The navy building has something written on the side of it, to the effect of: <em>"Lake Titicaca is the sea"</em>. Uh-huh, sure guys: whatever you say!</p>
