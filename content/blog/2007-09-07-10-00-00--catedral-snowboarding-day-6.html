<p>My first day of not snowboarding alone: yay!

Sadly, the weather was once again pretty shoddy today: snowing / raining all day, and the mountain was a white-out / blizzard by the afternoon. Nevertheless, we had plenty of fun, and we didn't get <em>too</em> soaked in the process.</p>

<p>My first day of not snowboarding alone: yay! Today, I caught the bus up to the mountain with <a href="/blog/ed-from-ireland">Ed</a> (who managed to rise from bed this morning) &mdash; we also met up on the bus again with <a href="/blog/paul-from-melbourne">Paul</a>, and his Brazilian friend &mdash; and together, we all went up the slopes on our funky snowboards. Sadly, the weather was once again pretty shoddy today: snowing / raining all day, and the mountain was a white-out / blizzard by the afternoon. Nevertheless, we had plenty of fun, and we didn't get <em>too</em> soaked in the process.</p>
<p>On my final run down the mountain today, there was one incident that would have been funny, if it hadn't happened in the middle of a freezing-cold blizzard. The weather-proof pants that I hired on Sunday have been starting to tear a little bit, over the past few days &mdash; but so far, it's been bearable. Well, this afternoon, my pants tore themselves completely open, right in the crotch. And so I had to snowboard all the way down to the bottom &mdash; with almost no visibility, and with ice-cold flakes of snow falling on me &mdash; having nothing between the fierce icy wind, and my balls, except for a thin pair of undies. Auuuugghhh! I hope I can still have kids one day, after that little adventure.</p>
<p>I stayed with Ed for most of the day &mdash; although he's been boarding a few times before, he isn't too far above my skill level &mdash; but we lost Paul and his friend earlier on. We also bumped into <a href="/blog/travis-from-colorado">Travis</a> again, towards the end of the day. As with <a href="/blog/catedral-snowboarding-day-2">day 2</a>, today we had to call it a day early (about 3:30pm), due to our being utterly frozen from the rain and the cold weather.</p>
