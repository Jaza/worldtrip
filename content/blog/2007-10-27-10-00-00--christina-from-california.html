<p>Christina's at the tail end of a 3-month trip around Europe, where (among other things) she's gone with several of her girlfriends on a road trip through the south-east (including the former Yugoslav Republic &mdash; brave girls!). She's in Bath for a few days (at <a href="/blog/st-christophers-inn-bath">St. Christopher's</a>), before continuing on to Cornwall and south-west England. She's from the Bay Area in California &mdash; even better, she's a Berkeley girl.</p>
