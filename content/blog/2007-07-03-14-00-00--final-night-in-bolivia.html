<p>My final night in Bolivia was spent in an extremely basic lodging, adjacent to the <a href="/blog/laguna-colorada-et-al"><em>Laguna Colorada</em></a> (which was the final sight of our <a href="/blog/salty-morning">Salar de Uyuni tour</a> for today), where we were very cold indeed. We combated the extreme cold of the high-altitude, non-heated night with a combination of games (Yahtzee, with my <a href="/blog/salty-dice">salty dice</a>; and cards), food (badly cooked spaghetti), and alcohol (fine Chilean wine, and some shots of premium Chivas whisky). The alcohol, in particular, proved to be an effective way to keep us warm and unconscious through the night &mdash; wouldn't have been possible otherwise.</p>
