<p>Tonight was my last night in the Big City of Argentina, and it was a good one, too. Had a big feed for dinner, following the <a href="/blog/yom-kippur-in-ba">long day without food</a>. And enjoyed the big party that they threw on the rooftop terrace of <a href="/blog/hostel-clan-ba">The Clan</a> this evening, where there was a live guest DJ, a crowded (albeit concrete patio) dance floor, and plenty of drinks to go round. When your hostel does gigs like that, who needs to go out? Indeed, I didn't end up making it to the clubs tonight, as the Clan party went on until at least 4am, conveniently located... well, upstairs :P.</p>
