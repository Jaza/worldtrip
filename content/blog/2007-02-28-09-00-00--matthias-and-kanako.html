<p>These crazy, married backpackers are two of the nicest and most streetwise people that I've travelled with so far. Both of them have spent over 10 years travelling to the most remote and out-of-the-way places on Earth. Matthias, a Frenchman, is an expert in cutting costs and in proving his favourite saying: <em>"you have a lot to learn about the French"</em>. Kanako, a Japanese girl, is much more adventurous than your average Tokyo girl.</p>
