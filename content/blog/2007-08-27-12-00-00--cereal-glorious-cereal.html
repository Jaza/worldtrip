<p>I woke up at <a href="/blog/hostal-de-sammy-santiago">Hostal de Sammy</a> this morning, and went downstairs for breakfast. And oh my g-d, they have <strong>CEREAL!!!</strong> Unlimited, crunchy-as-can-be corn flakes, with delicious full-cream milk. I never thought, in all my life, that I'd get so excited over a bowl of cereal: but after 5 months of subsisting on the only things on the menu that they have for breakfast, further north &mdash; <em>continental</em> (bread, jam, juice, tea), or <em>americano</em> (same, with fried eggs) &mdash; it was like a dream come true. I couldn't stop eating the stuff (got through 3 bowls, no probs).</p>

<p>And I couldn't stop laughing, at how absolutely, desperately ecstatic I was to be recovering from my months-long cereal withdrawal. Amazing how the little things in life can make such a difference. Looks like <a href="/blog/secret-garden-robbery">after all the terrible things</a> that <a href="/blog/rough-welcome-to-chile">happened to me</a> yesterday, G-d has answered my prayers. Today's looking to be a very good day.</p>
