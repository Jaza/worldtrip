<p>After <a href="/blog/pampas-trip-heading-out">completing our three-hour boat ride</a> down the river, our group arrived at the retreat in the <em>pampas</em> this afternoon: in time to have some fun on the rope-swing river kamikaze! The campsite has a tree right on the edge of the river, and there's a big rope with a wooden foothold tied to one of the tree's biggest branches. You grab the rope from the muddy shore, and you swing out over the river. Then &mdash; splash! &mdash; you bomb into the river's peaceful waters. We all had a turn on it; we all survived; and we all created some massive shockwaves in the water.</p>
