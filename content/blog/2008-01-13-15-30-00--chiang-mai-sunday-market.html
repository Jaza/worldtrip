<p>After <a href="/blog/cooking-in-chiang-mai">the cooking class</a> (and the enormous lunch that came with it), a few of us went over to Chiang Mai's Sunday market, which takes place just on the edge of the old city, in a long plaza just next to the canal. The Sunday market is a nice little tourist affair, but it's not very big and its variety is limited: just a few <em>shmontses</em> and <em>shmutters</em>, really. Lots of ornate bags and sashes, lots of bulk-produced little wood carvings, and lots of artwork and jewellery. Also some good <a href="/blog/return-of-the-fresh-juice">fresh juice</a> stalls, which my bottomless stomach still had room for, even after lunch.</p>
