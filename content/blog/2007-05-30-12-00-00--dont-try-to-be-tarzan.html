<p>It might look safe and easy and fun in the movies; but in the jungle, things break. On this morning's <a href="/blog/pilcopata-the-jungle-tour">jungle hike and tour</a>, we found a hanging vine, perfect for swinging on. We all had a go. I was fine, <a href="/blog/ashley-from-hampy">Ashley</a> was fine, <a href="/blog/stephan-from-hampy">Stephan</a> was fine, and <a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a> was fine. Then <a href="/blog/wil-from-amigos">Wil</a> went, and the vine snapped off. And down came Wil, from a height of about 1&frac12;m, and crashed onto his backside. Could have been any of us, but it just so happened that it was Wil. Anyway, be careful next time you're swinging in the jungle, OK?</p>

<p>It's all good when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan">Tarzan</a> does it. But in real life, it's not always a pleasant old swing. Wil seems to be alright from his fall; but his back is still hurting from the shock impact, and he's going to have to see a doctor when he gets back to Cusco, just to make sure that there's no serious damage. Hopefully he's fine.
