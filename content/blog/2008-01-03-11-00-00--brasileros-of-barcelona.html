<p>There are an awful lot of Brazilians staying here at <a href="/blog/kabul-hostel-barcelona">Kabul</a> with me. There are four of them that I'm sharing my dorm room with. There's the guy that I went <a href="/blog/exploring-barcelona">exploring Barcelona</a> this morning. And there are countless other little groups of them, that can be found hanging out in the bar on most evenings, or chatting in odd corners and in the hallways. They talk to each other in Portuguese, but most of them also speak excellent English (plus a little bit of dodgy Spanish). And <em>all</em> of them, without exception, have made it their personal mission to show <em>even Barcelona</em> how to party &mdash; because no-one parties like a <em>Brasilero.</em></p>
