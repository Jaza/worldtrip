<p>If there's one thing you simply <em>must</em> do when you visit Thailand, it's elephant riding. This afternoon, for the grande finale to our <a href="/blog/doi-inthanon-trek-begins">Doi Inthanon trek</a>, the 15 of us hopped onto a troop of 7 elephants, and went on a lumbering stroll around the jungle. The seats atop the elephants can only accommodate two persons each: and since we were an odd-numbered group, and everyone else was a pair, I ended up sharing an elephant with the German guys, and straddling the beast's enormous neck. It was a jolly old ride (if a bit uncomfortable for me): it's very impressive how these seemingly clumsy animals can daintily saunter up and down steep, narrow jungle trails; and it's good fun when they walk splashing right across a river, with you getting sprayed on top.</p>

<p>The whole affair wasn't that long &mdash; perhaps about &frac12; an hour of riding &mdash; but that's easily long enough to appreciate what you're doing, and for the novelty to run its course. When I jumped off the elephant, my a$$ was sore as hell for a few minutes, but I was otherwise good. We ended the elephant ride by snacking on some ice-cream and some strange, very bitter fruit (pomelo, I think?).</p>
<p>That marked the conclusion of the Doi Inthanon trek. After that, it was another long and boring truck ride back to Chiang Mai &mdash; I slept most of the way, and I said goodbye to all my companions when we arrived back in the big city. It's been a fun little tour: calling it a "trek" is a bit of a joke, in my opinion; and the 2- vs 3-day agency stuff-up was a pity and an aggravation; but it was certainly worthwhile, and it was good to get out and to see the jungle for a few days.</p>
