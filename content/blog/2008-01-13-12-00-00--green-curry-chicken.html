<p><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/5702">Green Curry Chicken</a> (in Thai: "Gang Kiew Wan Gai") is the classic Thai curry dish, and it remains my favourite of the nation's many curries, due to its rich coconut taste and its refreshing spice. The preparation for this dish can be quite long &mdash; especially if you need to prepare the curry paste yourself &mdash; however, as with most Thai dishes, actually cooking it is both quick and simple. "Gang Kiew" ("green curry") is generally cooked with "Gai" ("chicken"), but alternatives are fine as well.

<p><em>Gang Kiew Wan Gai: notice how the curry sauce has a grainy texture &mdash; this is a good sign that it's been cooked for long enough.</em></p>
