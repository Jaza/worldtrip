<p><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/5702">Green Curry Chicken</a> (in Thai: "Gang Kiew Wan Gai") is the classic Thai curry dish, and it remains my favourite of the nation's many curries, due to its rich coconut taste and its refreshing spice. The preparation for this dish can be quite long &mdash; especially if you need to prepare the curry paste yourself &mdash; however, as with most Thai dishes, actually cooking it is both quick and simple. "Gang Kiew" ("green curry") is generally cooked with "Gai" ("chicken"), but alternatives are fine as well.
