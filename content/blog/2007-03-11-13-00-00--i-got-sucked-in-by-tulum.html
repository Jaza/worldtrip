<p>I always intended to stay at least 3 nights in Tulum. It sounded like the ideal place to unwind, and to have a real holiday before the hard stuff begins. But I never thought I'd be here 6 nights &mdash; almost an entire week! That's triple the time I've stayed almost anywhere else in Mexico so far. Beware the magic of Tulum: it will suck you in; and after it's done with you, it will leave you longing for more.</p>
