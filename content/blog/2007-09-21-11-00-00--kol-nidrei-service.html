<p>This evening I returned to <em>Chabad la Metayel</em>, here in the downtown district of <abbr title="Buenos Aires">BA</abbr>, for the start of <em>Yom Kippur</em>. Despite the fact that they weren't giving out any free food tonight (since you <a href="/blog/the-steak-before-the-fast">have to fast</a> on <em>Yom Kippur</em>), there was still an ample turnout of long-haired Israelis. They did a very nice <em>Kol Nidrei</em> service, which went for about 3 hours; it was a bit harder to follow than usual, since they don't have any <em>machzorim</em> with English translation &mdash; but I still managed to stay on the right page throughout. I'll be back tomorrow, for the rest of the prayer services.</p>

<p>It was a little bit of a challenge, keeping <em>Yom Kippur</em> when I got back to <a href="/blog/hostel-clan-ba">The Clan</a> this evening, after the service. Every time a fellow roommate came into the dorm, they saw me quietly reading, and they asked: "aren't you coming up to the bar?" To which I replied: "sorry, not tonight"; and I had to repeatedly explain the reason behind this (virtually inexplicable, around here) act. I did actually consider staying somewhere else tonight &mdash; as The Clan is hardly the ideal place to read a book and to tuck in early, on a Friday night &mdash; but it turned out to be OK. I managed to wrangle my way out of the "Clan law" of "spending all night every night at the bar", and I even managed to get to sleep, despite the standard disco music thumping out loudly all night, upstairs from my room.</p>
