<p>Tonight will be remembered as the great feast night of Tulum. Kyden, Steve, and myself decided to make it a boys' cooking night, and we whisked up an authentic Mexican dinner of <em>tamales</em>, BBQ chicken, and <em>guacamole</em> that was extremely delicious, and that was also of ample quantity for about half the hostel to dig in and have a bite.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to join Kyden and Steve in doing the shopping, as they couldn't find me when they wanted to leave (I was down the road at the Internet caf√©). So I didn't have any say in what we were making, or in what ingredients we should get. But Steve, in particular, seemed to have a pretty good idea of what to make; and the two of them came back with some excellent ingredients.</p>
<p><em>The Weary Traveler</em> has a spacious, well-equipped kitchen, and we semed to have it almost to ourselves tonight. We had plenty of space to chop the meat and the vegies, and to mix up the <em>tamale</em> dough and the <em>guacamole</em>.</p>
<p>It was great fun cooking in the hostel &mdash; I'll have to try it again some time. Not only is it fun to do the cooking itself (just as it is back home); it's also great fun to listen to the advice of everyone around you (some people have better advice than others, though).</p>
<p>We ended up making much more food than the three of us could eat; so we invited everyone else who was around to come and help us finish it. Our offer of free food received ample responses &mdash; the people who ate with us were also nice enough to help us clean up, which was most appreciated.</p>
