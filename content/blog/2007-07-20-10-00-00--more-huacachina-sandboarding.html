<p>Since today was my last complete day in Huacachina, I decided to not spend the <em>entire</em> day relaxing by the pool, and to make the most of it by getting in some more sandboarding. The <a href="/blog/dune-buggy-and-sandboarding-in-huacachina">last sandboarding day</a> in Huacachina was wicked, and I've been itching to do some more. So I hired a board for a few hours, in the middle of the day, and went up and down the massive dune on the western side of the oasis (behind our hostel, <a href="/blog/casa-de-arena-huacachina">Casa de Arena</a>). Unlike on Wednesday, I actually managed to get down standing up &mdash; and with just a hint of style (but not too much, mind you) &mdash; rather than head-first, and flat on my stomach.</p>

<p>Since today was my last complete day in Huacachina, I decided to not spend the <em>entire</em> day relaxing by the pool, and to make the most of it by getting in some more sandboarding. The <a href="/blog/dune-buggy-and-sandboarding-in-huacachina">last sandboarding day</a> in Huacachina was wicked, and I've been itching to do some more. So I hired a board for a few hours, in the middle of the day, and went up and down the massive dune on the western side of the oasis (behind our hostel, <a href="/blog/casa-de-arena-huacachina">Casa de Arena</a>). Unlike on Wednesday, I actually managed to get down standing up &mdash; and with just a hint of style (but not too much, mind you) &mdash; rather than head-first, and flat on my stomach.</p>
<p>At first, I tried getting up the dune on the eastern side: this one doesn't seem to be as popular; but it's closer to where I hired the board from, and it looks a bit easier. However, for some reason, the sand is scorching hot on this dune &mdash; too hot to walk on (in sandals) without screaming in pain &mdash; so I didn't get too far up it, and it was a fairly average ride down that I got on it. After one try, I gave up and went over to the western dune.</p>
<p>The western dune is absolutely massive, and it's very steep. It's better to avoid climbing straight up it (don't be fooled by the well-trodden path that goes this way): instead, walk around to where the road goes over the rise, towards Ica, and climb up along the ridge from there &mdash; much less steep route to the top. Anyway, whichever route you take, it's a long schlep to the top &mdash; takes at least 20 minutes, and walking is the only option.</p>
<p>The first time that I went up today, I was just by myself. Had an absolute blast going down: I managed to stand up a fair bit (no going down on my stomach today!), but couldn't go for more than about 10 seconds at a time (usually more like 4 or 5, though), before I fell over in the sand. It's virtually impossible to turn on a sandboard &mdash; doesn't have anywhere near the control of a snowboard, or so I hear &mdash; so really, once you start reaching dangerous speeds, you have to fall over, in order to slow down ("slow down", as in "come to a complete and spectacular stop"). Feels incredible when you're actually on your feet, and riding the board down the hill; and falling over in the sand is actually quite fun as well. So really, it's all good.</p>
<p>Second time, I went up with 4 American girls and a Danish guy, that I'd met last night (actually had quite a big night on the town with them &mdash; and the girls were pretty hung over from it). I popped in to the hostel once I finished my first run, just to have a drink and a quick break, and I ran into them by the pool. For the girls, it was their first time sandboarding (and they're not snowboarders), so they were pretty crap at it &mdash; but they got down in the end, on their stomachs most of the way. The Danish guy is a snowboarder, and he's quite good on a sandboard too &mdash; he got some great runs on the way down, as did I.</p>
<p>It's very cool, being able to just grab a board for a few hours, and to go up and down the dunes at your leisure. It was very hot up on the dunes today, in the middle of the day (lucky I put sunscreen on &mdash; I needed it), but you cool down a lot when you whiz back down on your board. And you cool down even more when you reach the bottom, and you jump in the pool!</p>
