<p>Christian is a Belgian guy, and part of the (largely) French group that I bumped into <a href="/blog/down-to-paria">yesterday afternoon</a>. As I was hiking with this group all of this morning, and as Christian was the only one in the group to speak decent English, I ended up talking to him a fair bit. Really nice guy, just down here for a few weeks, for his summer vacation. Yay: more Belgians!</p>
