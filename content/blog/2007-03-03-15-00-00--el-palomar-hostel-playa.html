<p>This place, the no. 1 youth hostel in Playa Del Carmen, has its advantages and its disadvantages. Its plusses are: its location (middle of town, across from the beach); and the people you can meet there. Its minuses are: the lack of space (<em>really</em> cramped dorms, and a twisting spiral staircase); and the cost (cheap for <em>Playa</em>, but overpriced for what you get). If you can handle the minuses, it's a great place to stay.</p>
