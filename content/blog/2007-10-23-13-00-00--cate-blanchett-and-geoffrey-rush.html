<p>I'd just finished my <a href="/blog/the-london-guide-yer-bloody-self-tour">tour of London</a> this evening, and I was wandering around Leicester Square, when I noticed a big throng of people near one of the cinemas. I went to investigate, and it turned out that the red carpet was rolled out, in anticipation of no lesser stars than Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush (two of the biggest Aussie names in the world): they were coming here, for the UK premiere of their new movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414055/"><em>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</em></a>! Cate didn't come very close to the crowds; but Geoffrey came right up to where I was standing, and signed autographs &mdash; so I got some good shots of him. Check it out.</p>
