<p>This Dutch-speaking Belgian couple are on a really cool adventure: they're <a href="http://overlandadventure.be/">touring the continent in a converted Danish ex-army truck</a>! They're staying at <a href="/blog/hostel-paudimar-foz-do-iguacu">Paudimar</a>, here in Foz, where they have space to park the big boy. I was given a tour inside their (dont-f$%#-with-me) home for the year, and it's lovely on the inside. I went to the Itaipu dam with them today, and tomorrow they're crossing into Paraguay to continue their expedition.</p>
