<p>The dark horse of <a href="/blog/cooking-in-chiang-mai">today's cooking class</a>, this quiet and rather awkward young English guy came by himself and said very little. I talked to him a bit, and discovered that he's been in Thailand for some time, and that his passion is <em>Muay Thai</em> (Thai boxing) &mdash; a gruesome sport that makes its Western equivalent look like a pillow-fight (strange, as it's quite incongrous with the otherwise peaceful and friendly nature of Thai people). The English boxer has been to several of the infamous <em>Muay Thai</em> training camps &mdash; they admit keen tourists at some &mdash; and although he hasn't tried a proper fight yet, he claims that it's a great sport and that it's very fulfilling. I say "each to his own" &mdash; personally, I'd rather eat a raw cockroach than even watch one of those games, let alone participate.</p>
