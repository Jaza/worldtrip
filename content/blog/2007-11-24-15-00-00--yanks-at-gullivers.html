<p>As with the last time that I stayed at <a href="/blog/gullivers-house-rome">Gulliver's House</a>, this evening I found Rome's cosiest hostel to be virtually taken over by numerous young Americans. In particular, there were two guys who are currently studying up in Germany, and who came out with <a href="/blog/pei-from-hurstville">Pei</a> and myself for some dinner. Plus, there were a bunch of girls (also studying in Europe) who joined us later on for drinks. Nice group of kids, although a bit loud and obsessed with American football.</p>
