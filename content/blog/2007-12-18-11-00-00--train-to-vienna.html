<p>This morning I said goodbye to the crazy <a href="/blog/wombats-hostel-munich">Wombat's Munich</a> &mdash; and to Germany, for now &mdash; and hopped on the train down to Vienna. Just a quick 4-hour morning ride: I caught the 9:30am train (direct), and I was in Vienna by 1:30pm. The train went through Salzburg, which I'm going to visit <em>after</em> Vienna: it's a bit of a funny route, I know; but I can't help it, since Vienna's somewhat out-of-the-way from everywhere else I'm visiting around here.</p>

<p>I was welcomed into Austria by a gorgeous and dramatic change in scenery out the train window. Almost immediately upon crossing the border, flat frosty farmlands and woods gave way to soaring mountains, quaint hillside villages, and a blanket of pearl-white snow covering everything. Wow &mdash; so this is Austria! I'm really, <em>really</em> looking forward to going skiing here.</p>
