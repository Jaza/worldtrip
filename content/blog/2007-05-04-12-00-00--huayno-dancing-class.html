<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huayno">Huayno</a> is a traditional Quechuan style of music and of dance in the Cusco area. The music has a lot of guitar and high-pitched singing, and the dance has a lot of foot-stamping and stiff-leggedness.

Good bit of fun for a Friday afternoon, but it seems more like a stand-up comic routine than an actual, romantic folk dance.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huayno">Huayno</a> is a traditional Quechuan style of music and of dance in the Cusco area.

<p>A lot of the steps in Huayno (that's what we thought too &mdash; <em>why no indeed?</em> :P) involve having your left leg completely rigid, while bending and stamping with your right foot. When you do this really fast, it gets quite awkward, as well as tiring. I swear, the guy who invented Huayno must have had a wooden left leg, because the dance is perfectly designed for such a person.</p>
<p>Anyway, we started by learning and practicing the basic steps individually &mdash; as we did with salsa last week &mdash; and then trying out the dance in boy-girl pairs. Fortunately, we ended up being about equal, gender-wise, this week. I can think of better dances to do with a pretty girl; but hey, I guess that when in Rome, you gotta know what the Roman girls know; if you know what I mean.</p>
