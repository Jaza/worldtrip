<p>Robert is an Austrian fellow &mdash; <a href="/blog/adi-and-maria">another Austrian</a> from the city of Graz. He is, like, <em>sooo gay:</em> I'm sure he's not <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/littlebritain/characters/daffyd.shtml">the only gay on the island</a>; although he could very well be the only gay on tiny, secluded <a href="/blog/moondance-beach">moondance beach</a>. Robert runs a company that organises large, mainly homosexual parties and functions in Graz, and he's a very friendly and interesting guy. He's here in Ko Tao for a month (he's not going anywhere else in Thailand), where he's doing absolutely nothing, aside from lying on the beach and working on his tan.</p>
