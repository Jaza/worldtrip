<p>I've met a lot of interesting people on my trip, but Kate would have to be <em>the most</em> unique soul I've come across so far. She's been in South America for over a year &mdash; she lived in Cusco for 6 months, and she's just broken up with a local Ecuadorian boyfriend that she had for a long time &mdash; and she plans to go back to Cusco, and to live there indefinitely. She's a "healer" &mdash; you know, into traditional rituals, herbal medicine, shamanism, and all that tree-huggin' hippie stuff &mdash; and she wants to pursue healing as a full-time career move. Met her randomly in Chiclayo today, and had a great time hanging out with her and going sight-seeing with her.</p>
