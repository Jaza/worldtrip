<p>This week, I'm in a class of three, with two older American women. Chrystal is in her 50s, is travelling alone for a bit on her work vacation (she's a nurse), and is from a small town in Oregon. Ann is in her 60s, is travelling with one of her daughters (Amy, who's also studying here, in a different class), and is from San Jos√©, California (just near <a href="/locations/united-states/sunnyvale">Sunnyvale</a>, where the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">OSCMS Summit 2007</a> was!). Chrystal and Ann are both roughly on my level, in terms of Spanish skill, although they haven't had that much practice.
</p>
<p>We have two teachers, who take us for 2 hours each. Ursula has us from 8am-10am, and Merly has us from 10am-12pm. Quick break in between. Tea and lollies provided, on the house.
</p>
<p>It's a bit early to say for sure, but it seems that I made a good choice in enrolling here. Great people. Great environment. And great teaching.</p>
