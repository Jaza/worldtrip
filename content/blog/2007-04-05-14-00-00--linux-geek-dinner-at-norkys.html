<p><em>Some of the fine folks in the Lima Linux community.</em></p>
<p>Some of the other people there included Gabriel &mdash; at 16 years old, the youngest geek in attendance &mdash; Jose, and Jesus. I'm afraid that I can't remember everyone else's names: there were too many new faces, all in one go!</p>

<p><em>Looking down the geek table.</em></p>
<p>The other guys convinced me to try <em>anticuchos</em>, which are basically a kind of char-grilled kebabs that they do here in Peru. They taste very nice &mdash; like marinated steak, but on a stick! There was also a veritable mountain of food for everyone at the table.</p>
<p>I discovered tonight that <em>lime√±os</em> (i.e: <em>people from Lima</em>) aren't too keen on their vegies. Our mountain of food was quite thoroughly devoured by the end of the meal &mdash; all of it, that is, except for about 5 full plates of salad. Apparently, around here the phobia of greens is something that stays with you well past your wee years.</p>
