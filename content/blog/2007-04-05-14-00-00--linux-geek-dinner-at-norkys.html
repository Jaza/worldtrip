<p>After an afternoon nap, I met up with <a href="/blog/antonio-ognio">Antonio</a> again for dinner this evening. However, this time there were 10 of us dining together! Seems that Antonio managed to get together a whole bunch of Lima Linux people, and at very short notice. We went to a restaurant called <em>Norky's</em>, which does great meats of all varieties, and we discussed all things geeky.</p>

<p>Some of the other people there included Gabriel &mdash; at 16 years old, the youngest geek in attendance &mdash; Jose, and Jesus. I'm afraid that I can't remember everyone else's names: there were too many new faces, all in one go!

<p>The other guys convinced me to try <em>anticuchos</em>, which are basically a kind of char-grilled kebabs that they do here in Peru. They taste very nice &mdash; like marinated steak, but on a stick! There was also a veritable mountain of food for everyone at the table.

<p>I discovered tonight that <em>lime√±os</em> (i.e: <em>people from Lima</em>) aren't too keen on their vegies. Our mountain of food was quite thoroughly devoured by the end of the meal &mdash; all of it, that is, except for about 5 full plates of salad. Apparently, around here the phobia of greens is something that stays with you well past your wee years.</p>
