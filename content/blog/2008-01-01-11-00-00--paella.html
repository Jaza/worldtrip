<p>My first proper meal for 2008 was about as Spanish as it gets: <em>paella!</em> The classic dish <em>paella</em> is best described as an "everything you can fit in the pan" stir-fry: it generally consists at least of rice, egg, vegetables, numerous seafoods (e.g. prawns, oyster, lobster &mdash; sorry G-d), and chicken. For a very late lunch today (late by normal standards, although on-time by Spanish standards), <a href="/blog/miguel-the-mexican">Miguel</a>, <a href="/blog/emmanuelle-from-new-caledonia">Emmanuelle</a>, an Aussie Indian girl and myself found a great-value restaurant: 3 courses (<em>paella</em> was entrée) and wine, for just €8. Filled us up, <a href="/blog/feliz-ano-nuevo">woke us up</a>, and tasted tip-top.</p>
