<p><em>Patatas bravas</em> is a simple dish of boiled potatoes, chopped into pieces and covered in a hot chili sauce called <em>salsa brava</em>. This evening, <em>patatas bravas</em> became the first <em>tapas</em> dish that I've ever tried in my life &mdash; it may be one of the more common and ordinary of <em>tapas</em>, but boy do them potatoes taste good! I tried the dish at a place in central Madrid called <em>Las Bravas</em>, which is a crazy <em>tapas</em> bar that's crowded to the hilt, and where the only way to order is to push your way to the front, and to scream the name of your dish out over the cacophony. Highly recommended as an introduction to Spain.</p>
