<p>Ido is in the group adjacent to mine on the <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">Salkantay hike</a>, and he's both an intolerable and a friendly / entertaining guy, all at once. This is because of the (only) two things that he talks about. He's intolerable because he never stops talking about his love of Israel, about how proud he is to be an officer in the <abbr title="Israeli Defence Forces">IDF</abbr>, and about how defending Israel's right to exist is so important (bevakasha, habibi &mdash; genukh!). But he's also entertaining, because he also never stops talking about women: about adventures past with them, about crazy things he's done with them, and about which one's he's got the hots for right now.</p>
