<p>Basic, cheap, and friendly place, located a few blocks from the main square and tourist boulevard of Puno. The whole hostel is a bit squashed in, between other establishments; but the rooms aren't too small, and the staff are quite nice. We stayed here before and after our trip to Amantaní &mdash; decent enough crash pad.</p>

<p>Basic, cheap, and friendly place, located a few blocks from the main square and tourist boulevard of Puno. The whole hostel is a bit squashed in, between other establishments; but the rooms aren't too small, and the staff are quite nice. We stayed here before and after our trip to Amantaní &mdash; decent enough crash pad.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> basic, but nice (not really dorms &mdash; more private).</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> great: we met some people to go to Amantaní with at this place.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> quite friendly (no English).</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> a few blocks from the action in Puno.</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> both available downstairs at an extra cost (reasonable prices).</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> not entirely reliable (cut out for me once), but pretty good.</p>
