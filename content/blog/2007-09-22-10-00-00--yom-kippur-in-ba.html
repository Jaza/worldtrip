<p>Anyone who tries to claim that you can't backpack around the world &mdash; going from one party hostel to another &mdash; and still keep <em>Yom Kippur</em>: you're wrong.

<p>Anyone who tries to claim that you can't backpack around the world &mdash; going from one party hostel to another &mdash; and still keep <em>Yom Kippur</em>: you're wrong. It's possible, and I did it. Following on from the <a href="/blog/kol-nidrei-service">evening service</a> last night, today I spent most of the day once again at the local Chabad house, here in downtown <abbr title="Buenos Aires">BA</abbr>, praying for atonement and keeping the fast. Once again, a very nice day of services, and a good turnout of people to help make it happen.</p>
<p>Took a <em>siesta</em> of about two hours in the afternoon, during the quiet period before the morning and the final services. Once again, managed to "get by" reading in bed at <a href="/blog/hostel-clan-ba">The Clan</a>, even though this is definitely not the "done thing" around here. I got through the fast no problems: the <a href="/blog/the-steak-before-the-fast">massive steak</a> that I had yesterday, along with about 2L of water, seemed to do the trick just fine. And when the <em>shofar</em> finished sounding at the end of the day, and the holy day came to a close, we were even treated with some refreshing cakes and soft drinks at the <em>shul</em>. Another year, another <em>Yom Kippur</em>: only this time, it was a bit different.</p>
