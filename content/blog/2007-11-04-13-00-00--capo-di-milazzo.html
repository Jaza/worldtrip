<p>After a short <a href="/blog/gelato-in-milazzo">gelato break</a>, this afternoon I continued cycling up past the port town of Milazzo, to the Capo di Milazzo itself. Capo di Milazzo is a long, thin, steeply-rising cape, that sticks out into the sea from the north coast of Sicily. Getting to the tip of the cape proved harder than expected &mdash; I didn't realise how high-up the cliffs at the tip are, so it was uphill all the way &mdash; but once I made it, I was well-rewarded for my efforts. The views from the tip are stunning: as well as the gorgeous cape itself, you can also see the resort coast curving back into Sicily behind you, and the sea and the <em>Isole Eolie</em> in front of you. Lovely spot, especially with the sun waning at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I rode up to the tip of the cape, by way of the road that hugs its eastern edge. This was a difficult road: but I doubt that it would have made much difference which road I took, as it's steep getting to the end, and there's no way around that. When I was almost at the end, I stumbled across a campsite &mdash; however, I didn't enquire about spending the night there, as I planned to get beyond the cape today &mdash; I just asked them how to continue to the tip. This turned out to be (arguably) a mistake: but hey, I had yet to learn just how lucky it is to find an open campsite in Sicily in November :P.</p>
<p>Once you get past the big houses and the resorts, the tip of the cape is all protected parkland, with a lovely boulevard running down its spine, and with some sort of lighthouse at the end. You can't go to the lighthouse &mdash; but there's a park and a walking trail just past it, and that's open to the public. I decided to risk leaving my bike at the start of this trail for 10 minutes, and to walk down it for a bit: the views on the trail were stunning; and luckily, nothing happened to the bike. But I was a bit worried about doing this.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the hard work of reaching the cape was repaid at the end of the day: getting back off it was downhill all the way! So it was a quick, easy ride back to Milazzo, and virtually flat riding for the rest of the day, around the coast that continues west of the cape, and over towards Tindari.</p>
