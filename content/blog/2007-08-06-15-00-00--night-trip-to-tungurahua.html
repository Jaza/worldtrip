<p>This evening, <a href="/blog/patrick-the-belgian">Patrick</a> and I went on the popular night tour up to Tungurahua, the volcano that looms over Baños. Tungurahua was erupting last week, and we heard first-hand reports from people who'd seen lava coming out of it. Very cool! Although a bit crazy, since a large eruption is fully capable of destroying the entire town of Baños. Sadly, we didn't see any eruption tonight: but we still got a great birds-eye view of the town, lit up at night; and we had fun drinking a very strong distilled sugar-cane spirit, and watching some top-class fire-juggling up on the mountain. And a fun ride on the roof of the tourist truck, too.</p>

<p><em>Fire juggling: in the act. Thanks Patrick for the tip of increasing the exposure time on my camera: the effect is real cool.</em></p>
