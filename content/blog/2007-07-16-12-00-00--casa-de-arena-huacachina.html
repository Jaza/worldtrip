<p>Like most of the places to stay in the oasis of Huacachina, <em>Casa de Arena</em> is a very chilled-out resort-slash-hostel affair, with a nice swimming pool (a bit cold this time of year), a poolside bar, and a buffet BBQ every night (not only with all-you-can-eat chicken and salad, but also all-you-can-drink Pisco Sours and Cuba Libres!). Pretty good value, too &mdash; as evidenced by the abundance of (stoned) Israelis that stay there. Not sure when I'm going to leave this place, but it ain't anytime soon. :P</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> 15-person dorms are spacious and airy, and the beds are comfy enough.
</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> everyone's in resort mode here &mdash; as with everywhere in Huacachina, almost everyone is also stoned &mdash; so yeah, everyone's yer friend.
</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> very friendly, very talkative, and most can speak good English, as well as Hebrew that's better than mine. However, <em>nadie tiene nada cambio</em> (lit: "none of them have any change").
</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Huacachina's tiny, and it's inside it. 'Nuff said.
</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> no free food, but the s/5 breakfast is decent enough, and the s/20 buffet BBQ is shweetissimo. No Internet, but the only 'Net caf√© in town (total ripoff &mdash; s/3 per hour) is across the road.
</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> reliable, but not enough showers (for those in the dorms &mdash; many rooms with private bathroom are available) &mdash; 6 more are currently under construction.</p>
