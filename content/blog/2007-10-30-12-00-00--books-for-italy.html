<p>Before I scooted off out of England this afternoon, I managed to duck into one of London's big bookstores, and to stock up on some literary resources that I'll need for Italy et al. For my planned trip to Sicily, I grabbed a copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Traveler-Sicily/dp/0792295412">Nat Geo Sicily guide</a>, as well as a detailed (as in 1:200,000) map of Sicily, and another map of Southern Italy (from Naples to the tip). Additionally, I threw in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Italian-Phrasebook-Phrasebooks/dp/0864424566"><abbr title="Lonely Planet">LP</abbr> Italian phrasebook</a>; and for my journeying in Central Europe, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-German-Phrasebook-Phrasebooks/dp/0864424515">LP German phrasebook</a>. Hopefully, all that will get me through the next few months in Europe.</p>
