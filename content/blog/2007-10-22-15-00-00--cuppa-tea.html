<p><em>Shouldn't that be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Fair_Lady">Cup <strong>Of</strong> Tea</a>?</em> You can forgive me (I hope) for failing to visit the 'ol Bird (<abbr title="Also Known As">aka</abbr> Her Majesty) on me first day in London; but missing a cuppa &mdash; well, that would be a travesty beyond repent. Fortunately, I did manage to fit in a cuppa today, and I must say it was the best one I've had in a while. They give you milk without you asking. They use real tealeaves. And they serve it on a delicate little saucer, to make even the least snobby of us proud. Nothing like good English tea.</p>
