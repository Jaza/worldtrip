<p>An American guy showed <a href="/blog/tony-the-diver">Tony</a> and I a great little restaurant tonight. It's in the middle of Quito's overpriced, tourist-infested Mariscal Sucre district; and yet it's full of locals, and there are only two things on the menu: shawarmas, and beer! Only $1 each, respectively. The shawarmas taste great (be sure to smother them in the provided chili sauce), and they're best eaten on a 1-1 ratio with the large-size <em>Pilsener</em> beers. Relish the chow, get a bit drunk, and enjoy the local company. Nargila pipes (known as <em>pipas</em> around here) also available, if you're into 'em.</p>
