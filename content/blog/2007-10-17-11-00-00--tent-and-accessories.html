<p>My uncle David took me to a camping store this evening, called <a href="http://www.ems.com/">EMS</a> (Eastern Mountain Sports), where I got myself a lovely new tent. I purchased the <a href="http://www.ems.com/catalog/product_detail_square.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442585143&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302875851&amp;bmUID=1192901470838">Big Agnes Seedhouse SL1</a>, a compact 1-person dome tent that's suitable for backpacking trips. It's quite light, and it's also meant to be durable and waterproof. Also got myself one of those funky self-inflating sleeping mats; and a new compass and flashlight (as I lost my old ones). To find out <em>why</em> I bought a tent, and what I'm going to be <em>doing</em> with it, stay tuned for my upcoming adventures in Europe :P.</p>
