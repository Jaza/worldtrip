<p>This nice couple from Manchester &mdash; <em>"Home of the Manchester City team, not Manchester United, I'll have ye know"</em> (as Gaz says) &mdash; caught the bus with me from Lima to Ayacucho, and we hung out together in Ayacucho for a few days. Gaz is a mechanic for BMW, and Cath is a <abbr title="Physical Education">PE</abbr> teacher. Like me, they're on a year-long round-the-world trip (except they're nearing the end of theirs); and, like me and every other <em>gringo</em> in Peru, they're on their way to Cusco to do the Machu Picchu hike.</p>
