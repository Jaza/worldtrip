<p>My first purchase from the sprawling markets of <a href="/blog/khao-san-road">Khao San Road</a>, this evening, was a new backpack. <em>Jack Wolfskin</em> &mdash; high-quality German brand &mdash; and of course, this being Thailand, 100% genuine and original :P. For 400B (about $15), not a bad deal either. The plan is to leave my enormous bulky backpack (along with all my unneeded warm clothes and other accessories) in storage, here in Bangkok; and to travel around Thailand with this much smaller and lighter pack instead. 'Coz let's face it: you really don't need much when you're romping around in Thailand.</p>
