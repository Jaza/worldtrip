<p>I really did get absolutely filthy from my <a href="/blog/potosi-mines-tour">tour of the Potosí mines</a> today. They gave us special protective clothing, which we wore over our own, and then gave back to them at the end of the tour. I had a long and thorough hot shower, when I got back to the <a href="/blog/koala-den-potosi">Koala Den</a> this afternoon. And I took all my clothes to the <em>lavanderia</em> this evening, for an emergency laundry wash (making a special exception to <a href="/blog/jazas-law-of-washing">Jaza's law of washing</a>). And even with all that, I still can't get the nauseating smell of the mines off my person, or the taste of the mines out of my mouth. Really, really filthy place.</p>
