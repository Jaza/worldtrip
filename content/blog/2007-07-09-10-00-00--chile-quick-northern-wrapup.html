<p>It's been a quick whizz through the northern reaches of Chile, in between my <a href="/blog/bolivia-the-mad-wrapup">mad time in Bolivia</a>, and Peru Take Two. I didn't stay anywhere around here for longer than two days; and my whole time in Chile has been less than a week. But it was a good introduction to this very long country, and it was certainly a big, contrasting change from Peru and Bolivia. Anyway, I'll be back here in about six weeks' time; second time round to see Santiago and the Lake District, which I imagine will be very different to the deserts of the north.</p>

<p>It's been a quick whizz through the northern reaches of Chile, in between my <a href="/blog/bolivia-the-mad-wrapup">mad time in Bolivia</a>, and Peru Take Two.

<h2>Expensive</h2>
<p>Yeah, and apparently the north is a fair bit cheaper than the rest! Unfortunately, Chile is a lot more expensive than all of its neighbours. Transport, food, accommodation, and everything else: all at least double what you pay in Peru and Bolivia. It's a very western and a very developed country, but this comes at a high cost. Chile ain't the rough, exotic, and budget destination that other South American nations are. It's pricey. USD$10 minimum for a night's board: that's a small fortune, compared to the prices I'm used to.</p>
<h2>More like home</h2>
<p>The north is apparently the "less developed" part of Chile; but even up here, being in Chile feels almost like being back home, compared to the radically different &mdash; well, everything &mdash; that they have in Peru and Bolivia. People live in proper houses. They shop in supermarkets. Many of them have light skin, and are a bit taller. They've travelled outside their own country. They have high-speed Internet and cable TV in their homes. And they go to university.</p>
<p>Being developed and westernised is nice, but it's also boring and bland. Doesn't really hold much appeal for me. And, of course, it does raise those prices.</p>
<h2>You call that Spanish?!?</h2>
<p>In my past week or so here in Chile, I've barely been able to understand a word that anyone has said to me in Spanish. Chilean Spanish is absolutely <em>awful</em>! They talk really fast, they mumble like hell, and they constantly use local slang that I have no idea how to comprehend. As <a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a> and I have agreed on: <em>"they just vomit out their words"</em>. It would take me a lifetime living here, just to understand someone giving me directions to the bus station.</p>
<p>This is a big contrast to Peru and Bolivia, where I had no problem whatsoever understanding the slow, articulated, and textbook-like Spanish that they speak there. I guess it's because, for a lot of people in Peru and Bolivia, Spanish is their second language as well (first being Quechua or Aymara); so they too speak it like they were taught in school. Whereas in Chile, Spanish is all they speak, so they speak it as badly as we speak English. :P</p>
