<p>Over the past few days, I've been developing a bit of a cold.

Anyway, I guess all that partying over <a href="/blog/flannigans-et-al">Christmas</a> and <a href="/blog/feliz-ano-nuevo">New Year</a> has finally caught up to me: I am officially sick with the flu now. Mainly just gunk in the 'ol nose and throat &mdash; hopefully it won't get any worse than that. So I'm going to have to take it easy, until I shake off whatever it is that I've caught.</p>
