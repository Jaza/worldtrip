<p>After hanging out, meeting and greeting many of my fellow guests at <a href="/blog/gullivers-house-rome">Gulliver's House</a>, this evening a few of us ventured into the city, for a bit of a night out. <a href="/blog/pei-from-hurstville">Pei</a>, two of the <a href="/blog/yanks-at-gullivers">Yanks</a> and myself found a rather fancy <em>trattoria</em> restaurant at which to grab some dinner (the pasta was delicious, but small and quite expensive &mdash; this is why I generally avoid restaurants in Italy), as well as a nice jug of red house wine. As the night progressed, Pei retired back to the hostel, but myself and the two Yank boys met up with the remainder of the Yanks &mdash; the group of three girls &mdash; and together, we grabbed a few (massively overpriced but good) beers at a nearby Irish pub. I thoroughly enjoyed the night out. It gave me some much-needed socialising after my lonely ride through Sicily, plus it provided some (equally much-needed) relaxation after <a href="/blog/the-italian-night-train-job">today's nightmare</a>.</p>
