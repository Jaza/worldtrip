<p>This place is one of the best hostels I've been to, so far on my trip. Definitely up there with <a href="/blog/hostel-amigo-mexico-city">Amigo</a>, as a contender for <em>numero uno</em> in my good hostels book. At the moment, the owners are away, and it's being run by a super-friendly 6-foot-tall Kiwi guy, and his German girlfriend. These two are bending over backwards for their guests 24/7, offering us free food constantly (way above and beyond the complementary breakfast, which alone is the most gawdamn outstanding brekky I've seen this side of the Pacific), providing little luxuries everywhere (like soap, hand towels, and free local phone calls), and hanging out with the guests each night, and entertaining us with their lively company. And it's not in <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</a> yet, so <strong>just be sure to remember it!</strong></p>

<p>This place is one of the best hostels I've been to, so far on my trip. Definitely up there with <a href="/blog/hostel-amigo-mexico-city">Amigo</a>, as a contender for <em>numero uno</em> in my good hostels book.

And it's not in <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</a> yet, so <strong>just be sure to remember it!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> well-kept and quiet, and not too crowded.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> really friendly travellers here, most passing through and looking to exchange advice, and all of them more than happy to hang out and chat over dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> even more friendly than the guests! And super-relaxed about you taking all the liberties you could ever want (free of charge).</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> 5 minute walk from the bus terminal, and about a 30 minute walk from the centre of town.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> amaaaazing! Free breakfast to die for: cereal (with fresh milk), bread / jam, tea / coffee, juice, fruit (bananas, mandarins, kiwifruit), yoghurt, and more. <strong>PLUS:</strong> free use of whatever's lying around in the kitchen for your lunch or dinner &mdash; this includes rice, pasta, oil, spices, tea, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 2 PCs, both available unlimited for free, both with nice fast broadband, and one of which can be used all night (OK, so maybe that doesn't do it for <em>you</em> &mdash; but it sure as hell does it for me!).</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> strong, hot, and running 24/7.</p>
