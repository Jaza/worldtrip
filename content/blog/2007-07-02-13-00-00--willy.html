<p>Great little kid, and the eldest son (out of three kids) of our tourguide for our <a href="/blog/salty-morning">three days in the Salar de Uyuni</a>, Raul. This was Willy's first time tagging along with his Dad on a salt flats tour, and he loved it. He was brought along mainly to help with the cooking, but also to see how the tourguide thing is done (he'll probably be a guide too, one day), and just to enjoy the ride. I gave him my <a href="/blog/salty-dice">salty dice</a> at the end of the trip.</p>
