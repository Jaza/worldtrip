<p>In my past few days in Ecuador, I've already started to experience something that I didn't experience elsewhere in my South American travels, and that I find extremely brash and insulting. For a million little things around here &mdash; for bus tickets, for set lunches, and even for bottles of water &mdash; Ecuadorians seem to believe in "special tourist prices". I had about three incidents, just today, where the seller quoted me one price, and then suddenly changed their mind and said: <em>"hang on, actually it's $x more"</em>. And when I ask "why", they say: <em>"well, the first price is only for locals &mdash; you're a tourist"</em>. Pr#$ks.</p>
