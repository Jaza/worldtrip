<p>There's no Austrian dish more famous than schnitzel, and I could hardly visit the country without trying it at least once. This evening at <a href="/blog/yoho-hostel-salzburg">Yoho</a>, I ordered a plate of Weiner schnitzel for dinner (lit: "Vienna schnitzel"). Unfortunately, it wasn't actually made of veal, as a true Vienna cutlet should be (hey, we're talking hostel food here :P); but then again, at least it was chicken, as opposed to pork (which I've already <a href="/blog/pork-knuckle">been forced to eat</a> once too many lately, and which apparently can be found in many Austrian schnitzels). Not bad: but I'm afraid that <em>Il Bolognese</em>, an Italian restaurant in Sydney's humble suburb of Boronia Park, still takes the "best all-time schnitzel" prize hands-down.</p>
