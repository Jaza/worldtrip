<p>On the <a href="/blog/real-city-tour-of-cusco">real city tour of Cusco</a> today, I had my first sip of real <em>chicha</em>. Most places in Peru serve <em>chicha morada</em>, which looks (and kinda tastes) like grape juice, and which has little or no alcohol content. Real <em>chicha</em>, on the other hand, can only be found in <em>chicherias</em>, and is much stronger in alcohol content. Tastes pretty good, and at the dodgy <em>chicherias</em> in the slums, it's only s/0.30 for a big cup's worth. But you don't want to drink too much of it, or you'll end up like the alcoholics that hang around there all day long.</p>
