<p>Following the afternoon's <a href="/blog/stonehenge-tour">Stonehenge tour</a>, my final evening in Bath was quite easy-going. Just wandered up to the chill-out room at <a href="/blog/st-christophers-inn-bath">St. Christopher's</a>, and made good use of their extensive video library by watching a few movies. I saw one called "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117665/">Sleepers</a>", a disturbing but very well-produced film about boys in juvenile prison in the 60s. Also saw one of my old favourites, "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252866/">American Pie 2</a>", with a few crazy American kids, who wandered upstairs as well (their pick). Plus, I couldn't resist a <a href="/blog/english-vindaloo">bit more curry</a> for dinner. Nothing like a good Sunday night in front of the telly.</p>
