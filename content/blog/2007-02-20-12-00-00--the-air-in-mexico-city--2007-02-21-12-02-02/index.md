**Update:**

OK, maybe I was talking a bit too soon about the cleanliness of the air in Mexico City. After now having explored the city a bit further, I think that the air pollution is much worse on the city's outskirts, and even in the agricultural areas outside of (but near to) the city. The sky is very hazy in these areas, and the air is noticeably harder to breathe.
