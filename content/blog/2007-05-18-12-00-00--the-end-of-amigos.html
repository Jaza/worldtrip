<p>This morning, I had my final three hours of class at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>. So, after four intense and incredibly quick weeks, my Spanish classes have come to an end. I've had an amazing time at Amigos, I've made lots of really good friends, and my Spanish has improved tremendously. During the past week, I've had one-on-one classes with Merly, and we've covered heaps of ground in the various types of past tense (in particular). My new found knowledge in this area, and in general all-round vocabulary, has really empowered me to speak a lot more confidently and a lot more fluently.</p>

<p>I'm still with my family until Sunday, or possibly Monday, so I'll wait until that's all finished, before doing a comprehensive wrapup of my time in Spanish school and family home stay.</p>
