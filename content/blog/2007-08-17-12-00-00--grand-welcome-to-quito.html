<p>Tonight was one hell of a welcome and an introduction to Quito for me. After a sensational dinner of Thai curry chicken &mdash; on the rooftop terrace of the <a href="/blog/secret-garden-quito">Secret Garden</a> &mdash; I went out with some of the staff and fellow guests of the hostel, for a very big night on the town. The Mariscal Sucre area in the new town (otherwise known as "gringoland") is the place to go at night: and this being Friday night, it was absolutely packed with people. Can't remember what time I got home tonight, but it couldn't have been too long before the sun rose. Quite a few drinks, quite a few venues, and quite a <em>lot</em> of dancing. The parties never seem to end, here in Ecuador.</p>
