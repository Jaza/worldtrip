<p>Most Israelis in <abbr title="Buenos Aires">BA</abbr> choose to stay in one of about three "Israeli hostels", where they don't have to meet anyone else, and where they might as well never have left <em>Ha Aretz</em> at all. Michal and Or are in the small (but very nice!) minority that have chosen not to do this: they're currently the only two Israelis staying at <a href="/blog/hostel-clan-ba">Clan</a>. Great guys: they refuse to come with me to <em>shul</em> for the High Holy Days; but they don't mind going for a beer or a good feed now and then.</p>
