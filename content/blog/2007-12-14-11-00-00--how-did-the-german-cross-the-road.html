<p>There's one little eccentricity that I've not been able to help but notice, everywhere I've been so far in Germany. In Berlin and elsewhere, German people seem to have a uniquely large amount of patience and respect when crossing the road. The pedestrian traffic lights here in Germany enjoy taking their time: after the vehicle lights have completed their (also-slow) transition from yellow to red, the pedestrian lights take a further 4 or 5 seconds to register green. What with all this traffic-light sluggishness, you'd think that the poor pedestrians would tire of waiting for &mdash; well, for nothing &mdash; and would simply walk. But no: not Germans. Every single time, without exception, they wait the several seconds for the vehicle lights to turn red; and then they <em>keep waiting</em> another several seconds for the pedestrian lights to turn green; and <em>only then</em> do they cross the road. <em>In Deutschland, ve vait until it is time to cross &mdash; ve must not break ze rules, ja!</em></p>

<p>I'm finding this behaviour terribly amusing... and of course, <em>so German!</em> I can't think of many other places in the world where they'd do this. After Mexico, South America and (most recently) Italy &mdash; where traffic lights are strictly for decoration, and where crossing the road is an adventure not for the faint-hearted &mdash; it seems nothing less than absurd and inhuman to me. And I know it's naughty of me, but I can't stop thoughts from creeping into my head, that (jokingly, of course) allude to "Germans", and "just following orders" :P. I'm aware of The Golden Rule&trade; that applies when visiting Germany: but I must admit, there are many times when I find it shockingly, irresistibly tempting to Mention The War.</p>
