<p>"No name" vegetables is a crunchy Thai appetiser, which consists of chopped-up mixed vegies, that are battered and deep-fried into little snackable pieces. Best eaten dipped in sweet 'n' sour sauce. Not sure if they have it elsewhere in Thailand &mdash; I don't recall seeing it in Bangkok or in the north &mdash; but here in Ko Tao, most restaurants list it on their menu. At the remote restaurant this afternoon (after <a href="/blog/the-shortcut">bashing through the jungle</a>), my friend <a href="/blog/the-only-gay-on-the-island">Robert</a> introduced me to this dish, which I've never tried before, but which I hope to sample again.</p>
