<p>This Swedish brother-and-sister pair were staying with me at the <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a>. They're both fairly quiet, although not by Swedish standards, I guess. They're also both big drinkers and big smokers (however, Maja was sick for most of the week &mdash; so she had to drink and smoke <em>even more</em>, in order to get better :P). These two, myself, and Chris ended up hanging out together a fair bit.</p>
