<p>In relation to food &mdash; to meat in particular &mdash; <em>graso</em> means "fatty". Some meats, such as <em>carne de vaca</em> (beef) and <em>pollo</em> (chicken) are only <em>pocito graso</em>; others such as <em>tocino</em> (bacon) and <a href="/blog/cuy"><em>cuy</em></a> are <em>muy graso</em>. <em>Graso</em> is different to the word <em>gordo</em>, which is used to describe a person as fat or chubby. The noun <em>grasa</em> means "grease", "fat", or "lard" &mdash; so it's specific to animal products. Don't eat too much <em>comida grasienta</em> (fatty / greasy food), or you'll end up <em>gordito y feo</em> (<em>"fat and ugly"</em>)!</p>
