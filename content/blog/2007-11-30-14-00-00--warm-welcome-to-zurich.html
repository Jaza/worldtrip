<p>After six weeks of backpacking around Europe, this afternoon I arrived in the lovely Swiss city of Zürich (on the <a href="/blog/cisalpino-to-zurich">Cisalpino express train</a>), to have a small "holiday from the holiday", and to spend some time with my family here. I got a lovely warm welcome: I stepped off the train, and there was my <a href="/blog/mark-and-susi">uncle Mark</a>, standing right there on the platform, and wearing an unmissable Akubra hat so I could spot him! Mark drove me over to his plush dental practice, where he showed me around the establishment; then we were joined by Susi, and the three of us returned to their apartment, for a delicious home-cooked welcome dinner, and a long (and long-overdue) catch-up chat. Looks like I'm going to get very spoilt here, and that I'm going to have a fun and relaxing time in Zürich as well.</p>
