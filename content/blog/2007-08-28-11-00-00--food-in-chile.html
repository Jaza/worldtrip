<p>The food here in Chile is nothing amazing. It's no gourmet cuisine: the main things on offer are hamburgers and <em>empanadas</em> (meat-filled pastry pockets). The portions ain't huge. And, of course, it's expensive: approaching the prices back home, for food in take-away joints (and let's not even talk about the restaurants). So, it looks like I'll be eating sparsely and sparingly, for this week in Chile. Need to save up my appetite, anyway, for the non-stop steak-eating that will no doubt take place for the duration of my upcoming time in Argentina.</p>
