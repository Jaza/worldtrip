<p>I can't remember their names, but this young, Dutch husband-and-wife couple were two of the people with me on the <a href="/blog/doi-inthanon-trek-begins">Doi Inthanon trek</a>. We became acquainted when I jumped onto a <a href="/blog/bamboo-rafting-trip">bamboo raft</a> with them, and we remained chummy for the rest of the trip. Nice pair, and they're enjoying the hot Thai "winter" as much as all the other Europeans down here.</p>
