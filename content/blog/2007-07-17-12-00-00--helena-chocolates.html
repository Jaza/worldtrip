<p>I tried some of these delicious gourmet Ica chocolates on this morning's <a href="/blog/ica-winery-and-pisco-tour">wine and pisco tour</a>. They were so good, I just had to buy some! Got a few gift packages, to send home &mdash; to whom, I'm not yet sure. But boy, do they melt in your mouth. Clearly, Ica is the place to go, if you want all things nice and tasty from Peru.</p>
