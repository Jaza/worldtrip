<p>This evening's colourful introduction to cosy Pai was a visit to the town's night market. <a href="/blog/marie-and-claire">Marie, Claire</a> and myself went exploring the street or two that comprises the market: primarily to grab a <a href="/blog/grilled-rice-pancake">bite to eat</a> (actually, we <a href="/blog/corn-and-coconut-pancakes">grabbed several</a>), but also just to peruse. The food is definitely one of the market's highlights: although some of the dinner-food isn't so crash hot (my "omelette and rice" dinner was rather ordinary), the snacks are incredible. The shmontses are arrayed in abundance: some of them <a href="/blog/knitted-starving-ethiopians">quite amusing</a>, althogh most of them just regular hippie junk. The highlight of the market, however, is the nightly dance show: a large group of young local Thai girls perform an elegant traditional routine, garbed in their finest silks; while their friends accompany them with flutes and violins.</p>

<p>As the evening progressed, we gradually wandered away from the market streets, and began acquainting ourselves with Pai's bar scene. Pai is quite possibly <em>the most</em> friendly place on Earth: I'd say that about half the backpackers in town were crammed into one little bar this evening; and they were all so cheerful and extrovert, that I managed to meet the majority of them. We started at the "Buffalo exchange", a great joint on the corner of town, with a few couches inside and a roaring campfire outside. A few drinks and plenty of chatting there &mdash; and then on to several more venues, to pass the night away Pai-style.</p>
