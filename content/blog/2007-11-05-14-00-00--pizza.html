<p>It's no joke: when you go to Italy, you simply eat pizza everywhere you go. Pasta isn't so easy to come by &mdash; it's generally only eaten as an appetiser, and it's served only in proper restaurants &mdash; but pizza is eaten as a meal, and it's available cheaply and quickly. Most pizza in Italy is vegetarian &mdash; just the simple essentials, tomato and some herbs (and possible mushroom, or eggplant) &mdash; and it's available by-the-slice, or whole and fresh-cooked. Either way, it's delicious every time. beats Pizza Hut any day.</p>
