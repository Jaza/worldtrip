Or by most protestant countries; or <em>at least</em> by most English-speaking countries. But no: apparently, Boxing Day is only recognised and celebrated in England, and in a few countries in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations">British Commonwealth</a> &mdash; Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa, to be precise. Just goes to show: you learn something every day. Especially when you travel.</p>
