<p>Went and had a look at <em>Monasterio de Santa Catalina</em> today, a 400-year-old monastery and convent in the middle of Arequipa. Apparently, it's the only monastery in the world that's considered to be "a city inside a city". It's also still fully functioning, and inhabited by the same order of nuns that began it in Renaissance times. Interesting to see the antique sleeping rooms, the beautiful architecture, and &mdash; bizarrely &mdash; the ingenious laundry system that they have inside. Worth a wander, if you're in Arequipa and have an hour or so to spare.</p>

<p><em>Central cloister: I guess when the nuns are caught sleeping with Father Alberto, they get put up on these crosses.</em></p>

<p><em>They seem to be fond of staircases leading nowhere (just for show!). Maybe they're just made to sit and comtemplate life and Jesus on?</em></p>

<p><em>Laundry courtyard: has a mini-aqueduct that feeds a double line of large clay tubs. Strange and intricate setup, just to be able to wash yer robes, wouldn't you say? Personally, I think it's better suited to having a nice, warm outside bath on a sunny day.</em></p>
