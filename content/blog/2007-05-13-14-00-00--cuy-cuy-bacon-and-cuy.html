<p>Seriously, it's quite ridiculous: you actually <em>cannot</em> get anything else to eat in this town, apart from <em>cuy</em>. Today was also the <em>fiesta del cuy</em> ("festival of <em>cuy</em>" &mdash; not sure if it was just for today, or if they have this fiesta every Sunday). This wasn't so good for Jesus and myself, as Jesus was only up for a light meal, and as I didn't want to eat any meat, as I was still recovering from <a href="/blog/the-buffet-that-rose-again">yesterday's killer buffet lunch</a>. Anyway, we managed to subsist on some bread and bananas (that I brought from Cusco), and we found one <em>cuyeria</em> that (grudgingly) agreed to serve us some <em>papas con queso</em> ("potatoes and cheese" &mdash; without the <em>cuy</em>).
</p>
<p>By the way, the next town along &mdash; Saylla (one town closer to Cusco) &mdash; is just as bad. Only instead of <em>cuy</em>, their local specialty is <em>chicharrones</em> (a kind of BBQ minced pork). Same story there &mdash; if you're looking for anything other than a <em>chicharroneria</em>, then you've come to the wrong place. I already worked out that they love their meat here in Peru: but in these two towns, it's more of a religion than a casual fancy.</p>
