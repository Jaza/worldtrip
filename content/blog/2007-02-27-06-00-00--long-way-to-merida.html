<p>Just finished about 17 hours' worth of bus rides, to get from Veracruz to Mérida. This trip was way too long: I should have gotten a plane instead. Ah well: at least I saved on a night's accommodation, by getting a night bus and sleeping all the way.</p>
<p>The worst thing about this bus trip was not the trip itself. It was the fact that I arrived at the bus terminal in Mérida at about 5:30am. Too early to rock up at a hostel. Too bright and noisy to go to sleep. I killed about an hour by reading a book, then I buggered off outta there.</p>
