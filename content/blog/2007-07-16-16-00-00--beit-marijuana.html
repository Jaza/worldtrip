<p>Even more than the massive dunes and the sandboarding, there's one thing that Huacachina is very, very famous for. I believe that its official name is <em>Casa de Avinoam</em> (lit: "House of Avinoam") &mdash; that's what the blackboard-scrawled sign out the front says, anyway. Most people refer to it simply as "The Israeli place". However, I think the most appropriate name for it would be <em>Beit marijuana</em>, because that's where it gets its fame from: at the end of every meal, the waiters at this bizarre restaurant will give you a small complimentary plate of not-particularly-legal herbs, and some paper to roll it up in. The cuisine is great here &mdash; but let's just say that most people don't come here for the food.</p>

<p>I haven't actually ordered a meal there, but we popped into "The Israeli place" after dinner tonight, looking for a drink or two. Didn't end up ordering anything, as it's a bit expensive, and as we were feeling a bit out-of-place, being the only non-Israelis there. As they say, you don't have to be Jewish to come here, but you know, <em>"it wouldn't hoyt"</em>. The place was filled with little groups of hairy, loud Israelis, drinking coffee and smoking Nargilla, over a game of cards, dominoes or sheshbesh.</p>
<p>Just a pity that I don't smoke (anything): because if I was going to start, this would be one hell of a place to do it. Anyway, it's an experience just walking in to a place like that. If free weed is what you're looking for, then you'll have no trouble whatsoever finding it in Huacachina.</p>
