<p>We went to Uxmal in the afternoon. This is typically the busiest time of the day for ruins; and although there were quite a lot of tourists around, I didn't feel that the place was being overrun. Uxmal is also quite big, and some areas had a bit less tourists than others.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not permitted to climb the great pyramid at Uxmal. However, there's a temple at the top of a steep hill, and there are ancient steps carved into the hillside, which anyone can climb.

<p>In accordance with Matthias's policy of being "super-cheap", we hung around a few tour groups as they were going around, and eavesdropped on what the guides had to say.
</p>
<p>We also came back to Uxmal in the evening, after the <a href="/blog/corrida-in-santa-elena">corrida in Santa Elena</a>, and saw the light show in the main Maya plaza area. This is a very impressive show, with all the ruins lit up in eerie colours, and with dramatic music and booming Spanish narration. Although the show was, at the end of the day, a tacky technique, they did it so well that it didn't really seem that way at all.
