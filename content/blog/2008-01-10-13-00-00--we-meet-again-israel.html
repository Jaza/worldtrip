<p>So strong is the Israeli presence here in Bangkok, that there's even a <a href="http://chabad.org/">Chabad house</a> right on Khao San Road itself. Flanked by massage-parlours-slash-brothels, tattoo stores and seedy <em>farang</em> bars, it's one of the biggest and most prominent buildings in the street: it has an enormous lit-up vertical sign down its side; there's a kosher falafel shop downstairs; and upstairs is (I assume) a fully-functioning synagogue. This is the first place I've ever been, where "Chabad House" is actually listed in my <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</a>! You can find it under "eating" (the "Israeli" sub-category) in the Khao San Road section.</p>
<p>Although Israel does indeed dwell in Bangkok with great force, the Israeli factor is actually not too bad here &mdash; I was expecting far worse than what I've encountered. I think the reason for this is that there are simply masses of people from <em>everywhere</em>, here in Bangkok: so many different national and cultural groups are here, and all in such large numbers, that Israelis are relegated to being no more than "one more group". Also, it seems that although it's still extremely cheap, Thailand's prices have been rising steadily (on the back of its burgeoning economy) over the past few years, while its neighbours &mdash; particularly Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam &mdash; continue to offer maximum bang-for-buck. Hence, less Israelis are visiting Thailand than did previously, while more are instead heading only to the other countries of south-east Asia.</p>
