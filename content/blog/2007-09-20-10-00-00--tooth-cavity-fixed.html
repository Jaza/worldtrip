<p>When I <a href="/blog/dental-check-up-in-ba">went to the dentist</a> two days ago, my check-up revealed that I had a cavity. Today I went back to the friendly, English-speaking folks at <a href="http://www.dental-argentina.com.ar/ingles/home_ingles.htm">Dental Argentina</a>, and got the cavity fixed up. Only took about an hour, and I hardly felt a thing. Ah, the miracles of local anaesthetic. Once again, they were very professional, very well-equipped, and very cheap. And hopefully, I don't have to go to the dentist again for a while :P.</p>
