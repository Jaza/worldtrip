<p><em>Buenas noticias</em> (lit: <em>"good news"</em>), people: as of lunchtime today, Mario's back! <em>Él Papá</em> returned home at about 2:30pm this afternoon, in time for the all-important middle-of-the-day meal. He's still going to need at least another week of serious <abbr title="Rest and Recuperation">R&amp;R</abbr> at home; but he's looking happy and healthy, just like his old self. We welcomed him home with flowers, kisses, hugs, and plenty of good food (a welcome change from those hospital meals). He should be back at work within a week or so.</p>

<p>Now that Mario's back home, life has already returned to normal around here. Flora and the rest of the family are no longer spending every spare minute of the day out at the hospital. The mood in the house is happy and carefree once more. And everyone is nice and talkative.
</p>
<p>It's Flora that needed this return more than anyone else. The past week-and-a-half has been very tough for her, and she really wore herself out, looking after her husband in hospital. Hopefully, she'll be able to relax and unwind as much as Mario will, over the next week. She needs it.</p>
