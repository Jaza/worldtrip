<p>Tonight was Saturday night. I'm in Bariloche. And I've <a href="/blog/catedral-snowboarding-final-day">just finished</a> doing seven days of intense snowboarding. I don't know what you would have done like at a time like this &mdash; but for me, the appropriate course of action seemed obvious enough. Party! Thus it was that, after dinner tonight, I went with the <a href="/blog/patanuk-hostel-bariloche">Patanuk</a> crew down to <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Place/argentina/san-carlos-de-bariloche/wilkenny/6400.htm">Wilkenny's</a>, an Irish pub and club in the middle of town, and one of the most popular places to rev up the night in Bariloche. Packed with overpriced imported beer, with all the usual music (well above full volume), and with many a fellow latin-dance-challenged <em>gringo</em>, it made for one hell of a night. <em>¡Viva Bariloche!</em></p>
