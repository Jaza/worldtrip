<p>Juan Carlos is a young guy who really has a right to be proud of himself. He's the <em>"director of activities"</em> &mdash; basically the second-in-command &mdash; at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>. He was one of the first kids who went through the community English-learning program, which the school runs for disadvantaged kids in the local area. Now, he's a fluent English-speaker, he's an important part of the school's administration, and he's a great guy and a friend to everyone around him.</p>
