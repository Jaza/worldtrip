<p>I've had a really enjoyable few days on Ilha Grande; but sadly, my flight out of São Paulo leaves tomorrow morning, and if I miss it I'm royally screwed. So this morning I had to say goodbye to this island paradise, and to begin making my way back to the mainland, and over to South America's biggest city. It took a full day &mdash; a ferry ride all morning, and a bus trip all afternoon &mdash; but after a great deal of time spent sitting on these various vehicles, I got to São Paulo. Now it's more sitting, and sleeping, as I wait for my plane.</p>

<p>I've had a really enjoyable few days on Ilha Grande; but sadly, my flight out of São Paulo leaves tomorrow morning, and if I miss it I'm royally screwed. So this morning I had to say goodbye to this island paradise, and to begin making my way back to the mainland, and over to South America's biggest city. It took a full day &mdash; a ferry ride all morning, and a bus trip all afternoon &mdash; but after a great deal of time spent sitting on these various vehicles, I got to São Paulo. Now it's more sitting, and sleeping, as I wait for my plane.</p>
<p>My mate <a href="/blog/tom-from-ireland">Tom</a>, who I've been hanging out with on Ilha Grande for most of the week (and who was on the bus that I took to get there, in the first place), also decided to leave today &mdash; so the two of us ended up getting the ferry and the bus together. The 10:30am ferry out of the island (the only one for the day!), was a nice enough trip &mdash; the waves and the wondrous coastal views rolled by us, as we chugged our way back to the mainland &mdash; although at 1&frac12; hours, it did drag on quite a bit.</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to catch the 12pm bus out of Angra Dos Reis (headed to São Paulo) just in time &mdash; a good thing, too, since the next one wasn't 'til about 3pm. And it's a whopping <em>7 hours</em> on the bus, to get from Angra to SP! It doesn't look like that far on the map, but apparently it's far enough to take you the better part of a day. Anyway, the bus wasn't too bad &mdash; they showed a movie or two on the trip, and the air-con wasn't up <em>too</em> high this time &mdash; although we did do the usual Brazilian thing, of stopping a ridiculously large number of times, for food and toilet breaks.</p>
<p>We got in to SP at about 7:30pm: in time for Tom to buy another bus ticket (an overnight ticket), for a bus straight to Florianopolis, where he's planning to spend more time drinking and enjoying some surf (in that order &mdash; he <em>is</em> Irish, you know). Anyway, we said our goodbyes in the bus terminal there; and then, I jumped on a shuttle bus, to take me over to SP International Airport. I've decided that since my flight is at 6am tomorrow morning, it's really not worth going to a hostel for tonight &mdash; I may as well just try and get a bit of sleep in the airport, and catch up on the rest during my three-legged flight to New York, which will take up my whole day tomorrow.</p>
