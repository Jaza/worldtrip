<p>Adam's barmitzvah celebrations began tonight, at the <a href="/blog/the-goldstein-bempechat-clan">Goldstein</a> house, with a fully-catered shabbat dinner. Big crowd &mdash; much of the extended family arrived this evening, mainly from New York and Philadelphia &mdash; and plenty of new (and very distantly-related) relatives to meet. The food was great, and it flowed from the kitchen in copious quantities. A very nice, <em>heimische</em> start to the <em>simcha</em>.</p>
