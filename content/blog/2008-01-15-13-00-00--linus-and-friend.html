<p>Two of the people on the <a href="/blog/doi-inthanon-trek-begins">Doi Inthanon trek</a> with me, Linus and his friend are a pair of young Swedish friends. I can't remember the friend's name; but I remember Linus, of course, because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">that name's fame</a>. One of these guys looks pretty Swedish; but the other is black as can be, and is clearly not of Swedish ancestry! These two guys are nice enough, although they're not the most talkative pair &mdash; and they prefer to speak to each other in Swedish, than to talk to the rest of the group in English (unlike most Swedish people I've met on this trip).</p>
