<p>When I realised that I'd <a href="/blog/oops-pisco-high-camp">gone the wrong way</a> this morning &mdash; to the Pisco high camp, instead of to the famous Laguna 69 &mdash; I thought that I wouldn't be able to make it to the laguna today. But as it turned out, I was able to have my cake and eat it too: I made it to Laguna 69; and boy, was it worth it. Quite a stunning place indeed.
</p>
<p>The guys at Refugio Peru pointed out to me that there's a path, which runs from the Pisco high camp over to the laguna. It's a very high path &mdash; over 5000m for most of the way, and much more difficult than the regular path to the laguna &mdash; but they said that I should be able to do it in two hours.
</p>

<p>The path was really difficult to follow at first &mdash; just a maze running through a minefield of big rocks &mdash; but after the initial bad start, it turned out to be very clear, and not too much hard work. At the start of the path, I bumped into an American guy who was also on his way to the laguna: but since I was in a real hurry, and since he just wasn't going terribly fast, I had to leave him behind. Anyway, they said it would take me about 2 hours to reach the laguna, and I did it in 2&frac12;: not a bad effort.
</p>

<p>Following the initial rocky maze, the path started out very steep, ascending well into a snow-prone altitude (although there was very little snow or ice on the path, the whole way), and getting up to the high ridges. Lucky I left my big backpack and my tent down the bottom, at Cebollapampa &mdash; this path would have really sucked, if I was <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=schlep">schlepping</a> all that stuff. After that, it was relatively flat for a long way, following the high mountain ridges, and offering great scenery of the snow-capped peaks all around.
</p>
<p>The path went at high-altitude (i.e. 5000m+) for so long, that I began to wonder if it would ever start to descend. But it finally did descend, not long before the end (and quite steeply, too): and when Laguna 69 finally came into sight, I was taken away by this spectacular mountain lagoon, which I was fortunate enough to see from my special, high-up vantage point.

<p>I made it down to the laguna by about 12:30pm. I gave myself &frac12; an hour to have a snack &mdash; not a proper lunch, as I left that back in my tent at Cebollapampa &mdash; and to relax and to bask in the serenity. There were a few other people at the laguna: but considering that it was Sunday lunchtime, and that it's the most popular day-hike in the Huaraz area, there weren't that many. Maybe they get more people during the week? Or maybe it was just quiet, because of this being <em>28 de Julio</em> (Peru Independence Day) weekend.

<p>I walked back to Cebollapampa along the normal valley path (the one that I couldn't find this morning), which usually takes 2 hours or more, but which I did in just over 1&frac12;, due to my rushing to get back to camp. Probably rushed more than I needed to &mdash; but oh well, I thought that all my morning detouring had made me quite late. Plus, I wanted the rest of my lunch! More beautiful scenery, on the way back through the valley &mdash; which, additionally, was pleasantly downhill all the way.

<p>Dunno why, but it turned out to be Aussies all the way, hiking back from the laguna this afternoon. Met two Aussie girls, who I overtook on my hasty route back. Also met a very well-travelled old couple from Budgewoi &mdash; not far from Wyong, on the <abbr title="New South Wales">NSW</abbr> Central Coast (just north of Sydney). They said that this is their <em>sixth</em> visit to South America, in 6 consecutive years, and that they just can't get enough of all the hiking and adventure to be had, especially here in Peru and Bolivia. Good on 'em, I say.
</p>
<p>Once I got back to Cebollapampa, that was pretty much the end of my 5-day Santa Cruz-Llanganuco hike. I dove into my lunch (the rest of last night's rice and tuna &mdash; never tasted so good!), packed up the rest of my gear, and then walked the 5 minutes out of the campsite, and onto the main road. Managed to get an amazing deal, for my transport back to Huaraz: s/10, for a direct ride back in a private taxi!
</p>
<p>Went with two French people in the taxi: they insisted on going back only to Yungay (from where you can get a cheap <em>combi</em> ride, the rest of the way back to Huaraz); but the taxi driver clearly needed to get back to Huaraz desperately, and to take as many people with him as possible; so he offered us s/10 each for the ride, when he was originally going to charge me alone s/20 for it. Not a bad deal: although considering how far the ride was, I felt a bit bad, as it was basically bordering on highway robbery.
</p>
<p>Turned out to be a bigger day than I'd planned on &mdash; a lot of tough walking, when I thought it would be a very easy-going, final-day walk to Laguna 69 &mdash; but it was great fun, and a great end to an amazing hike.</p>
