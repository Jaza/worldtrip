<p>I didn't have long to spend in Frankfurt &mdash; just tonight &mdash; and I made it a quiet one. I did a little bit of shopping in the area around Frankfurt <abbr title="Hauptbahnhof">Hbf</abbr> (central station): it's a seedy and unattractive red-light area; but it's also packed with numerous indistinguishable cheap variety stores, where I was able to finish off some of the things that I still hadn't replaced <a href="/blog/the-italian-night-train-job">since losing them</a> (e.g. new headlamp, new combination padlocks). The free pasta dinner at <a href="/blog/stay-and-learn-hostel-frankfurt">Stay and Learn</a> was good: and I met an interesting Brazilian guy over dinner, as well as a big group of Italian students (mainly girls), with whom I had a nice shmooze. Other than that, it was just a bit of online time &mdash; I met a random Peruvian girl at the cafe down the road &mdash; and then off to bed, in preparation for tomorrow's early start.</p>
