<p>I did my third and fourth dives this morning, and they're the final dives that I need to do as part of my <a href="/blog/padi-diving-course-begins">Open Water course</a>.

<p><em>The crew, headed back to Sairee &mdash; Caroline made it for the diving today.</em></p>
<p>I must say, I enjoyed today's dives more than yesterday's. The fact that I'm getting used to the underwater environment may have something to do with it. Or it could just be the fact that we saw some really cool fish today: bigger, more colourful, and more intrepid than those we encountered yesterday; as well as some massive schools that numbered in the hundreds.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the same old hurdles came back to haunt me: descent and equalisation was still a painful and unpleasant ordeal &mdash; and the fact that we descended deeper today, only made it worse. I'm now officially a <a href="/blog/padi-open-water-certification">PADI Open Water certified</a> diver: but for the life of me, I really don't feel like one. I feel pretty useless underwater, and I doubt that I'll ever get as much out of diving as do others, who are seemingly born to hit the depths. Perhaps I'll do diving again someday &mdash; but for now, I don't think it's for me.</p>
