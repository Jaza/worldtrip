<p>Ralph's a retired primary school teacher, who &mdash; when he's not hiking in exotic locations around the world, such as Nepal &mdash; enjoys living a quiet life on his hobby farm in north-western Tasmania. Met him on Isla Del Sol this morning, on our <a href="/blog/isla-del-sol-northern-end-hike">hike to the northern end</a> of the island; and ended up chatting to him a fair bit about life and travel. Real character, and an incredibly warm guy.</p>
