<p>Two young English girls, that I ended up <a href="/blog/stroll-up-volcan-villarrica">climbing Volcán Villarrica</a> with today. They're actually travelling with one other English girl, but their friend couldn't make it today, as she was a bit sick. Great sports, and (like me), looking forward to plenty more travelling and advnturing for the rest of the coming year.</p>
