<p>After a month of Mexican hostels, I'm more certain than ever that <a href="/blog/hostel-amigo-mexico-city">Amigo</a> is the best damn hostel in the country, and it was great to return and to spend one last night here. I didn't do anything much for my final night in Mexico; just hung out at <em>Amigo</em>, and had some drinks with the other folks staying there. Also had a little reunion with <a href="/blog/alan-the-brit">Alan</a>, who has returned from his volcanic expedition, and who's going back home to England soon.</p>
