<p>Pei's a dinky-dai Aussie girl from the Hurstville area, in Sydney's south. Her family's of Chinese origin, although she can barely speak Chinese herself, and considers herself to be as true-blue as the rest of 'em. Pei's travelling for several months, and has just arrived in Europe from sunny Thailand, where she's been backpacking for the past several weeks (so I had plenty of questions to ask her &mdash; since I'm off to Thailand after Europe). I went out with Pei and with several other people at <a href="/blog/gullivers-house-rome">Gulliver's House</a> this evening, for a bit of dinner and fun.</p>
