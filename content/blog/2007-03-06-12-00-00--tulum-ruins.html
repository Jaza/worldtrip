<p>Steve, Kyden and I went and saw the ruins near Tulum beach this morning. It was great weather on the beach; but unfortunately, we got there too late to beat the crowds (about 10am). The ruins are very nice, but they're not quite on the same scale as most of the others. The best thing about them is the gorgeous cliff-beach-and-sea backdrop that enfolds them. Back in the day, this really must have been prime Maya real estate.</p>

<p>The three of us at first tried to execute the well-known trick of entering the ruins via Tulum beach, and thus of avoiding the entry fee. But after scrambling some way around treacherous cliff promontories, with a Mexican Army guard tower looming over us (I assume that they don't shoot tourists, but you never know!), we decided to give it up. I don't know why so many people report it to be easy to sneak in to Tulum &mdash; if there is an easy (and free) way in, we weren't taking it.</p>

<p>After walking back around to the front entrance, and paying the 45-peso entry fee, we spent a while exploring the ruins. Like I said, the ruins are not particularly impressive, and the crowds are rather massive; but the environment is gorgeous.</p>

<p><em>Ruins and ocean.</em></p>
<p>There's a small beach in front of the ruins, and because it was such a nice day, plenty of people were swimming in it. We joined in and had a little dip ourselves.</p>
