<p>Last night was fairly quiet at the <a href="/blog/cloud-forest-hostel-chugchilan">Cloud Forest Hostel</a>. Only about 6 of us for dinner (including <a href="/blog/patrick-the-belgian">Patrick</a> and myself), and not much else to speak of. But tonight, we had a massive crowd (most of which was YABFTG &mdash; <em>yet another <a href="/blog/pourquoi-tant-francais">big French tour group</a></em>), and an impressive traditional dance show, from a group of local little village girls. I guess that even here in Chugchilán, Friday night's a big one.</p>

<p>Last night was fairly quiet at the <a href="/blog/cloud-forest-hostel-chugchilan">Cloud Forest Hostel</a>. Only about 6 of us for dinner (including <a href="/blog/patrick-the-belgian">Patrick</a> and myself), and not much else to speak of. But tonight, we had a massive crowd (most of which was YABFTG &mdash; <em>yet another <a href="/blog/pourquoi-tant-francais">big French tour group</a></em>), and an impressive traditional dance show, from a group of local little village girls. I guess that even here in Chugchilán, Friday night's a big one.</p>
<p>The dancing was fairly ordinary to begin with &mdash; just the usual funny little skips and hops in a line, and the obligatory whining highland music (on an incredibly scratched CD) &mdash; but then it got better. The little girls (most of whom looked to be about 10 years old) brought out a pole with 8 cords of cloth hanging off it, and they proceeded to plait the cords around the pole, by dancing in a weaving pattern! This was quite cool, and it actually looked quite hard &mdash; they must practice a lot, in order to be able to do it so flawlessly. Was even more impressive when &mdash; having plaited the entire length of the pole in cloth &mdash; they then danced in reverse, and undid the whole thing.</p>
