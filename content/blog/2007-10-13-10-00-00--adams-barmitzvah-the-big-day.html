<p>This was it: today was Adam's barmitzvah! In the morning, we had the service and the torah call-up; and in the afternoon, we had a colossal lunch in the <em>shul</em> hall.

<p>This was it: today was Adam's barmitzvah! In the morning, we had the service and the torah call-up; and in the afternoon, we had a colossal lunch in the <em>shul</em> hall. All of this was at the conservative synagogue that my cousins go to, just down the road from their house in Newton Center. Adam did a great job on stage: read his portion very confidently, and gave a solid and well-intentioned speech. And needless to say, the lunch was scrumdiddlyumptious.</p>
<p>I remember that we went to the Goldsteins' synagogue, when we came to Boston seven years ago. It doesn't look much different now &mdash; very big and modern new building, and a warm congregation. For those of you that aren't familiar with it, conservative is somewhere in between orthodox and reform, as far as synagogues go: since reform is so extreme here in the USA, they have to have something in between. The conservative service is pretty similar to the orthodox one, prayer-wise: it's just that the men and women sit together, the women can read from the torah, they can use microphones and drive, etc. Personally, I think I'll always prefer orthodox &mdash; it's what I've grown up with, and it is "the real thing" (rather than a made-up half-version of Judaism) &mdash; but they certainly do a nice job here at conservative.</p>
<p>My <a href="/blog/dad">dad</a>, my <a href="/blog/ivor-and-manuela">uncle Ivor</a> and myself all got call-ups, which was a cool little honour. We also got quite a big mention in Janine's speech at the lunch &mdash; more than we needed... but anyway. And also, Becca volunteered to do some reading from the torah as well, and she did an amazing job of this: seems that she's able to perform some full-on, professional-level laning. Not bad.</p>
<p>As well as the titanic buffet spread, the lunch was also made memorable by the great klezmer music band, that they hired for the occasion. The musicians were very lively; but even more lively was the crazy Russian guy in charge of the dancing! He wouldn't let us just stand around, and hold hands and look like idiots &mdash; like you're <em>meant</em> to do at a barmitzvah &mdash; oh no sirree, none of <em>that</em> today! We did elaborate run-ins, we did trains around the room, we did hat-dances, we did concentric rings &mdash; we did it all.</p>
