<p>Well, considering i'm not carrying the olympic flame, i dont really have any physical baton to pass on to you as I finish my 'tour' and you start your world trip so i'm just gunna say  my 2 pence. or riel if ur coming to Cambodia, which as a matter of a fact dont have coins or denominations lower than 50(just thought u'd like to know)<br />
So yeah, i'm glad that my mum, Auntie Sue, has been conferring with ur mum, Jeremy's Mum, so that we will be reading each other's online 'secret' diaries. This way i'll know when u get to try those delicious deep fried cocharoaches, or steamed dog, or so i'm told. Or perhaps get hopelessly lost in the middle of Hanoi, and ending up walking off the map.<br />
As for advice, try to keep ur blog updated at about twice a week, that is try not to go 3 weeks like i have with out a post haha! Also you might be surprised how bad the internet can be, especially if there happens to be an earthquake that cuts the major linking gateways to the region during ur trip... so as for uploading photos... consider yourself warned.<br />
otherwise Enjoy!!</p>

<p>This is the first blog entry on my new world trip site. Welcome! There isn't much content on this site yet, but I will be filling it up with stories, photos, and much more, over the coming year.

<p>As you can find out from looking on the <a href="/about">about</a> page, in 3 weeks' time I will be leaving my home town of <a href="/locations/australia/sydney">Sydney</a> &mdash; and my home country of <a href="/locations/australia">Australia</a> &mdash; and embarking on a world trip for 12 months.

<p>This site was made using <a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, along with a number of Drupal's fabulous add-on modules. Some of the cool features of this site &mdash; and the Drupal modules that power them &mdash; include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="/gallery">gallery</a> that lists photos</li>
<li><a href="/blog">Blog entries</a> that contain embedded photos</li>
<li>A <a href="/locations">locations</a> index that plots all the places I've visited on a <a href="https://maps.google.com/">Google map</a> (using the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/gmap">GMap module</a> and the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/location">Location module</a>)</li>
<li>A <a href="/tags">tags</a> page that lists all the site's tags (used to classify blog entries) in a tag cloud (using the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/tagadelic">Tagadelic module</a>)</li>
<li>A consistent, hierarchical navigation tree for the whole site (using the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/category">Category module</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Come back regularly, because I'll be updating this site regularly as I traverse the globe!</p>
