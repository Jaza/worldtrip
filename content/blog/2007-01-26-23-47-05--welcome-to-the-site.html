<p>This is the first blog entry on my new world trip site. Welcome! There isn't much content on this site yet, but I will be filling it up with stories, photos, and much more, over the coming year.</p>
<p>As you can find out from looking on the <a href="/about">about</a> page, in 3 weeks' time I will be leaving my home town of <a href="/locations/australia/sydney">Sydney</a> &mdash; and my home country of <a href="/locations/australia">Australia</a> &mdash; and embarking on a world trip for 12 months. I've made this site in order to let people know where I am and what crazy things I'm up to, and also to permanently document what is sure to be the journey of a lifetime.</p>

<p>This is the first blog entry on my new world trip site. Welcome! There isn't much content on this site yet, but I will be filling it up with stories, photos, and much more, over the coming year.
</p>
<p>As you can find out from looking on the <a href="/about">about</a> page, in 3 weeks' time I will be leaving my home town of <a href="/locations/australia/sydney">Sydney</a> &mdash; and my home country of <a href="/locations/australia">Australia</a> &mdash; and embarking on a world trip for 12 months. I've made this site in order to let people know where I am and what crazy things I'm up to, and also to permanently document what is sure to be the journey of a lifetime.
</p>
<p>This site was made using <a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, along with a number of Drupal's fabulous add-on modules. Some of the cool features of this site &mdash; and the Drupal modules that power them &mdash; include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="/gallery">gallery</a> that lists photos</li>
<li><a href="/blog">Blog entries</a> that contain embedded photos</li>
<li>A <a href="/locations">locations</a> index that plots all the places I've visited on a <a href="https://maps.google.com/">Google map</a> (using the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/gmap">GMap module</a> and the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/location">Location module</a>)</li>
<li>A <a href="/tags">tags</a> page that lists all the site's tags (used to classify blog entries) in a tag cloud (using the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/tagadelic">Tagadelic module</a>)</li>
<li>A consistent, hierarchical navigation tree for the whole site (using the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/category">Category module</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Come back regularly, because I'll be updating this site regularly as I traverse the globe!</p>
