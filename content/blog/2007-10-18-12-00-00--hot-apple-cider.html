<p>Along with the <a href="/blog/chicago-dog">Chicago dog</a>, this is another must-have consumption for your next visit to Salem. There's a café down near the docks, that will do you a delicious big cup of hot, fresh apple cider. I've never had one of these before &mdash; but after having sampled a cup's worth, I highly recommend it! Full of fresh apple; very sweet; and satisfyingly warm. The perfect beverage to warm you up on a cold, foggy New England day.</p>
