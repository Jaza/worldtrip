<p>I've heard the stories, same as everyone else. But I must admit, I never took them <em>that</em> seriously. Well, I should have believed &mdash; because every tale that ever passed by my ears is 100% true. Bangkok really <em>is</em> full of 50-year-old American men, walking hand-in-hand (or hand-somewhere-else) with 19-year-old Thai girls. And despite the blatant grotesqueness and desperation, most of them stroll the streets loudly and proudly, with no shame whatsoever. It's cliché, it's oh-so-stereotypical, and it's downright sad &mdash; but when you look around you, it's undeniable: this is the true story of "Thai love". This is one strange, sleazy and deplorable place: never before have I seen romance being so widely touted to the highest bidder.</p>
