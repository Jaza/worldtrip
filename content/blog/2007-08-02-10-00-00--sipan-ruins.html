<p>When the tomb of <em>El Señor de Sipán</em> (lit: "the Lord of Sipán") was discovered in 1987, it made world headlines, as it was the biggest discovery of un-looted ancient gold to be made in modern times. The tomb was filled with literally hundreds of priceless, pure gold artifacts. It put Chiclayo on the map as a tourist destination in Peru (although to this day, it's still fairly off the <em>gringo</em> trail, compared to the madhouse further down south), and it made the (previously unheard-of) impoverished backwater town of Sipán a household name. However, most tourists choose to go only to the <a href="http://www.tumbasreales.org/">Museo de Tumbas Reales</a> in Lambayeque, which is easier to get to, and which is where all the gold is now located. This leaves the site of the tomb itself as a more quiet spot, for the more keen and adventurous tourists to explore.

<p>I didn't bring <a href="/blog/kate-the-healer">Kate</a> with me today, as I couldn't find her (she's staying in a different hostel to me, and her cell phone wasn't working when I tried it), and as she isn't that keen on ruins anyway. Good thing she didn't come, too; 'cause it was a pain in the a$$ to get to, and an equally big pain to get back from. Unlike with Lambayeque &mdash; which has <em>combis</em> running back and forth from it every 5 minutes &mdash; I had to wait over an hour to catch a <em>combi</em> to Sipán, and almost as long to catch one back. Apparently, this is because the Sipán area is more sparsely-populated, and also much more poor; and as such, the people around here aren't given very good public transport by the government. I had a <a href="/blog/on-the-tourist-economy">chat with a local in Sipán</a> about this, and various other issues, for quite a while this afternoon, while I was waiting to get a <em>combi</em> back to Chiclayo.

<p>The ruins of Sipán were pretty quiet this afternoon. Just me, a few other random solo travellers, and one tour group of gaggling German families, and their German-speaking guide. Nice, relaxed place. If you have the time to spare, I recommend going out and seeing it. A bit off the beaten track (although really, it's an important site, and more people should visit it), and quite interesting and beautiful.</p>
