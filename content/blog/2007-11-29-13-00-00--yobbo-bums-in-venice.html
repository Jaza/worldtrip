<p>I had a mad pre-dinner Venetian adventure this evening: I attempted to go to the supermarket and buy some wine (to do with dinner), and to find a public call centre (for ringing my Uncle in Switzerland, who I'm supposed to be visiting tomorrow); however, I failed to do either of these things. Instead, I narrowly missed various shop closing times, got extremely lost in the bowels of Venice, and ended up completing an epic run through the cobbled alleyways &mdash; and miraculously finding my way back to the hostel &mdash; in order to get back in time for dinner. Anyway, it all ended well: I collapsed back into the hostel in time for another night of delicious pasta (plus more wine &mdash; not everyone missed the shop closing times); and after that, <a href="/blog/the-venice-fish-crew">the crew</a> (some old faces from last night, some new ones tonight) went out onto the streets, bought a large quantity of beer, wine and <em>sangria</em>, and got wasted by the Canal Grande: what a bunch of yobboes we were, drinking on street in Venice! Nothing quite as fun as doing something completely uncultured and improper, in one of the great cultured and refined cities of the world.</p>
