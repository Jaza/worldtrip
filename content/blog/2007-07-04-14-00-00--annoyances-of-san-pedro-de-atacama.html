<p>I only have three serious gripes with this small, mostly charming little town in the middle of Chile's northern Atacama desert, and they are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Internet is really, really slow here &mdash; slower than anywhere in Bolivia (and that's saying something)</li>
<li>The prices are ridiculously high, even for Chile (e.g. some places are charging as much as USD$10 per person for dinner &mdash; waaay more than what I've gotten used to lately)</li>
<li>Despite being significantly lower down than the Bolivian <em>altiplano</em> (a mere 2400m <abbr title="above sea level">asl</abbr>), it's still freezing cold here at night</li>

<p>Other than that, San Pedro really is quite a beautiful place. It really is a tiny town: not much here, except for a gaggle of tourists, and the various businesses that serve us (e.g. hostels, tour agencies, restaurants, bus stations). But it's very clean, very laid-back, and very quaint. Also has quite a strong "frontier" feel to it; and rightly so, since it is the main tourist gateway from Chile to Bolivia, and vice versa.</p>
