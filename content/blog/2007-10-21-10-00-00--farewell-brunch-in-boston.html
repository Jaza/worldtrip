<p>After almost two weeks here, my <a href="/blog/dad">dad</a> and I are finally saying goodbye to the cousins (and to each other), and leaving Boston. To farewell us in style, the <a href="/blog/the-goldstein-bempechat-clan">Goldsteins</a> took us to <em>The Cheesecake Factory</em> &mdash; a fine restaurant not far from Newton &mdash; for a Sunday brunch. The strawberry pancake thingies were sensational: although they were so big that even I, pig-out waste-nothing shoestring-backpacker that I am, couldn't finish mine.</p>

<p>Since this is the last day with my family, and since my next stop on this trip is super-expensive Europe, this could well be the last proper meal that I have in a while. Good thing that I filled up: I certainly won't be able to afford any restaurant dining, once I'm east of the Atlantic!
