<p>Sophie's a lovely girl from a tiny town near rural Cheltenham, in England. I met her today on the <a href="/blog/dos-rios-hike">hike to Dos Rios</a>, here on Ilha Grande. She's a very good-looking girl, but is unfortunately taken (don't you just <em>hate</em> it when that happens?) &mdash; her boyfriend, apparently, is currently travelling in Australia. Sophie has the ambitious aim of covering both South and Central America within the next 4 months: I say to her, good luck.</p>
