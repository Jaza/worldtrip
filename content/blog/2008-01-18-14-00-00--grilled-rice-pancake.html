<p>Grilled rice pancake was one of the many delicious, fresh-cooked street snacks that I discovered at the <a href="/blog/pai-night-market">Pai night market</a> this evening. Its appearance is not so appetising: it's black and flat and slimy, and it looks not unlike what I imagine a female uterus would appear like (when grilled). But don't be deterred by this: the pancake is sweet and chewy, and it's divine. Best eaten fresh off the coals, in no more than 5 bites and gulps.</p>
