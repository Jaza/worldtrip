<p>An <em>abrazo</em> is a hug. Hugs are very important the world over, but they're even more so over here in the Latin world. When you meet someone around here &mdash; whether they be a long-lost friend or a complete stranger &mdash; you give 'em an <em>abrazo</em>. A handshake simply will not do. A <em>beso</em> (kiss) is also required, when meeting with the ladies (any ladies). When you write someone a card in Spanish, it's common to end it with the salutation <em>un abrazo</em>, or simply <em>abrazos</em> (where we might write "best wishes"). The verb <em>abrazar</em> means "to hug": so when I meet someone in Peru, <em>yo le abrazo</em> (lit: <em>"I hug them"</em>).</p>
