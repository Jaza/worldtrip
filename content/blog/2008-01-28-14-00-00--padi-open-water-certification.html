<p>Courtesy of <a href="/blog/bans-diving-resort-ko-tao">Ban's</a>, I now proudly possess a <a href="http://www.padi.com/"><abbr title="Professional Association of Diving Instructors">PADI</abbr></a> Open Water certification. The goodies that come with this include: a diver's handbook (which, being certified, I ostensibly know from cover-to-cover); a diver's logbook; and a temporary PADI membership card. My permanent membership card, which needs to be processed by the PADI head office in the States, will be mailed to me within the next few months. Plus, one other very useful perk: I'm now listed in the PADI global online database, which means that should I ever go diving again, my certification can be checked online by any dive shop in the world.</p>
