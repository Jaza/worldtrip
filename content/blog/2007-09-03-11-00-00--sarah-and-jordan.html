<p>This brother-and-sister couple arrived in <a href="/blog/patanuk-hostel-bariloche">Patanuk</a> today, and they're staying for the rest of the week. They're both from Colorado: Sarah still lives there, but Jordan's living in LA, where he's going to "school" (i.e. Uni) at <abbr title="University of California, Los Angeles">UCLA</abbr>. As with all Coloradans, they love their mountains and their mountain activities. They're here to do a bit of hiking, a bit of snowbaording, and a lot of partying.</p>

<p><em>Sarah and Jordan at Patanuk.</em></p>
<p>Oh yeah, and they're Jewish too. Always good to have some fellow Yids around &mdash; added bonus if they're fellow non-Israeli Yids! :P</p>
