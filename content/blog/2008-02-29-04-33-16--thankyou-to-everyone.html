<p>For my absolute final entry on this blog (I swear, this is <em>it!</em>), I would like to take a few moments and a few kilobytes to thank everyone that was part of this trip, or that made it possible, in any and every shape and form. The <a href="/blog/here-at-the-end-of-all-things">previous entry</a> was really the last page; so think of this as the epilogue, or simply as the credits. If there's one thing I've learned on this trip, it's that it's not where you go, it's who you meet; and that it's not places, but people, that make a big trip (and life in general, really) such an amazing experience. I hope I've remembered everyone of import here; but if I've missed you out, then I deeply apologise &mdash; and feel free to post a scathing comment, in which you make yourself and your significance known for all eternity. We do ask that you remain seated, and that you leave your mobile phones switched off, until the blog has come to a complete stop in front of the terminal building. Once again, thank you for flying with Jaza's World Trip, and we hope you enjoyed the flight.</p>

<h2>Drupal people</h2>
<p>Thankyou to <a href="/blog/famous-people-of-drupal">everyone that I met</a> at the OSCMS Summit in Sunnyvale; you're all doing fantastic work, and you're the best community that anyone could hope to be a part of. Thanks for pulling off a thoroughly enjoyable conference. Thanks Bill for letting me sleep on your couch, when I missed the last train back to San Fran. Thanks Ian for the Peruvian connections. And thanks Chx for giving me the chance to finally meet you offline.</p>
<h2>Cusco connections</h2>
<p>Thankyou to the amazing folks at <a href="http://www.spanishcusco.com/">Amigos Spanish School</a>, who did so much more than merely teach me a truckload of Spanish. Thankyou to my loving <a href="/blog/staying-with-the-polar-covarrubias-family">host family</a>, who fed me mountains of food, and who gave me love and friendship even in difficult times. Thankyou to all my fellow students &mdash; <a href="/blog/louis">Louis</a>, Monica, and all the others &mdash; for some very good times.

Thankyou <a href="/blog/jacinta-from-amigos">Jacinta</a>, and good on you for coming back and helping out at the school.

And, of course, an enormous thankyou to <a href="/blog/jorge-from-hampy">Jorge</a>, for establishing the great organisation that you've got running, and for giving me the biggest opportunity on my entire trip to not just observe the big wide world, but to contribute something back to it.</p>

And an enormous thankyou to <a href="/blog/the-belgian-front">Stef and Annick</a>, my amazing Belgian friends from the Salkantay hike, for having me spend the weekend with you in Turnhout, and for the most fun and crazy time that I had in all of Europe.</p>
<p>Thankyou to all the many locals in South America and in Thailand, who gave me so much help when I was a lost stranger, and to whom I'm very much indebted. Your names are too numerous to recall &mdash; but in particular, thankyou to all the many, many tourguides and other guides that I've had during this trip, for all the assistance and guidance that you've given me, and for watching out for me when it mattered most.</p>
<h2>Overseas family</h2>
<p>A mammoth thankyou to <a href="/blog/the-goldstein-bempechat-clan">my cousins</a> in Boston, for going out of your way for me during our stay; and just as big a thankyou to <a href="/blog/tara-and-ashki">Tara and Ashki</a>, for having us in your house for two whole weeks, and for letting us use your meteor-sized TV and your beefy Internet-enabled laptops. Also, thankyou <a href="/blog/dad">Dad</a>, and <a href="/blog/ivor-and-manuela">Ivor and Manuela</a>, for giving me the opportunity to rendezvous with you, and for a very special family reunion abroad.</p>
<p>Thankyous upon thankyous to <a href="/blog/mark-and-susi">Mark and Susi</a>, my aunt and uncle in Switzerland, for letting me crash in Zürich for a week, and for absolutely spoiling me rotten. Thankyou so much for helping me to sort out the delivery mess, and to eventually receive my new ATM card, after the terrible ordeal that I'd gone through since being robbed in Italy. Also, sorry that I ultimately couldn't visit my uncle Michael or my auntie Nanda in England &mdash; pity it didn't work out this time, and hopefully we'll be able to meet when next our paths cross.</p>
<h2>Everyone back home</h2>
<p>Last but not least, thankyou to all of you who have supported me from back home during my travels, who have contacted me while I've been away, and who have followed my adventures from time to time on this blog. Thankyou to all my readers, and I can only hope I've lived up to your expectations. Thankyou to my incredible friends: in particular, to Liam and Sepehr &mdash; if you must know, you two were the hardest thing about leaving Sydney for a year; and a big thankyou also to Josh, Steve, Honour, Arthur and Qian. Thankyou Daniel for your support as well during my trip, and sorry that I ultimately couldn't make it to Israel to visit you. Thankyou Dave Burnett for everything you've ever done for me, and for everything you've ever been to me, over our many years as friends; and to this very minute, I'm still struggling to accept the fact that you are tragically no longer with us.</p>
<p>And to really finish everything off, I must thank my loving and supportive family, without whom this trip simply could not have happened. Thankyou to my cousins Talia and Michaela, and to Ivor and Manuela; and thankyou to my cousins on the other side, Josh, Dana and Natalie, and to Linda and Peter (thanks for the Thailand tips!). Thankyou to Nana and Poppy, whom I've missed over the long months. Thankyou to Dad, Sharon, Lara, Nattie, George and Judy, for everything and so much more, including for storing all my possessions in my absence, and for giving me a bed when I returned. And thankyou Mum, for managing my finances and admin tasks, for attempting to marry me off despite (or because of?) my being out of the country, for moving on with your life and thus helping me to move on with mine, for worrying about my laundry and my eating habits from the other side of the world, and for being the best Jewish mother that any son could ask for. Thankyou to all my family, for being there for me before, during and after this trip, always and forever.</p>
