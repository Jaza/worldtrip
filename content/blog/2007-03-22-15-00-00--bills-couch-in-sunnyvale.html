<p>After Day 1 of DrupalCon finished, we all went down to the Sunnyvale Sheraton for some drinks and mingling, and then we continued on to the Firehouse bar-slash-restaurant for more of the same. By the time we were done drinking and mingling, I'd missed the last <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">Caltrain</a> back to San Francisco. Luckily, the very kind and magnanimous <a href="http://www.funnymonkey.com/">Bill Fitzgerald</a> let me crash on his motel room couch for the night. So I spent one night in Sunnyvale itself!</p>

<p>I gotta admit, it did make it a bit easier getting over to Yahoo! for day 2 of the conference. Rather than getting a bus, a train, and a light rail, Bill and I walked up the road a few hundred metres.</p>
