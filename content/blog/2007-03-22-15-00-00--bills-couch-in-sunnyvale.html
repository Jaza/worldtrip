<p>After Day 1 of DrupalCon finished, we all went down to the Sunnyvale Sheraton for some drinks and mingling, and then we continued on to the Firehouse bar-slash-restaurant for more of the same.

<p>Hello, Jeremy,
</p>
<p>Glad to help out -- it would have been a long slog to up to SF and back, particularly seeing how the train had stopped running :)
</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing how the South American leg of the world trip unfolds.
</p>
<p>Cheers,

<p>I gotta admit, it did make it a bit easier getting over to Yahoo! for day 2 of the conference. Rather than getting a bus, a train, and a light rail, Bill and I walked up the road a few hundred metres.</p>
