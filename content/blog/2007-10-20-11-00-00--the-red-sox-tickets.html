<p>Our friends and hosts <a href="/blog/tara-and-ashki">Tara and Ashki</a> were very lucky today: they managed to score two free tickets to tonight's Red Sox baseball game, here in Boston's Fenway Park! Normally, Red Sox tickets are virtually impossible to obtain unless you're a club member with a season pass &mdash; and even then, you're looking at a minimum of $200 a pop. However, they happen to be best friends with another couple, who <em>are</em> club members, and who <em>do</em> have season passes, but who realised at the last minute that they wouldn't be able to make it to tonight's game. So their friends were kind enough to donate their tickets to them. Not a bad deal at all.</p>

<p>Tara and Ashki were so excited about this opportunity, and so desperate not to let it slip by, that they drove back from their <a href="/blog/house-to-ourselves">holiday in Vermont</a> yesterday (and then drove back to Vermont, and then back to Boston again this evening), in order to pick up the tickets. I don't blame them: considering how hard and expensive it is to usually get tickets, and considering what massive fans they are of the Red Sox, it was the best little miracle since <a href="/blog/bagels-and-cream-cheese">bagels and cream cheese</a>.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the game was also very much worth seeing, as the Red Sox cained the Cleveland Indians in a landslide 12-2 victory. The Red Sox are doing very well this season &mdash; and because my cousins live here in Boston, and because I've spent more time here than anywhere else in the US, they are by default the American Baseball team that I support. So I was barracking for them too, and I was as happy as anyone when they won! <a href="/blog/dad">Dad</a> and I saw the game on Tara and Ashki's massive widescreen TV, back at the house: almost as good as being there, but not quite.</p>
