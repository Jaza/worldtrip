<p>Just for a bit of a laugh, an Irish guy at <a href="/blog/loki-hostel-cusco">Loki</a> walked down to the <em>Plaza de Armas</em> (main square of Cusco) with me this morning, to introduce me to the insane amount of tourist-hassling that goes on in this city.  However, instead of letting these people get on <em>my</em> nerves, I decided to turn the tables a bit, and to get on <em>their</em> nerves, by playing an evil little game.</p>
<p>The two of us walked down the side of one block of the <em>Plaza de Armas</em>, and we literally did get about ten offers in ten seconds. This is what I did as we walked past:</p>
<p><em>Postcard, amigo, very &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>UNO!</strong></p>
<p><em>Massage amigo &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>DOS!</strong></p>
<p><em>Tour de Machu Pi &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>TRES!</strong></p>
<p><em>Massage &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>CUATRO!</strong></p>
<p><em>Desayuno, muy bar &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>CINCO!</strong></p>
<p><em>Tours, horseriding for y &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>SEIS!</strong></p>
<p><em>Massage amigo &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>SIETE!</strong></p>
<p><em>Dolares, good price &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>OCHO!</strong></p>
<p><em>Massage &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>NUEVE!</strong> (And will you <em>please</em> $%#&amp; off with the damn massages!)</p>
<p><em>Machu Picchu &mdash;</em></p>
<p><strong>DIEZ!</strong></p>
<p>Each time someone offered us anything, I shouted a number at them (as illustrated above), and stuck the corresponding number of fingers in front of their faces. Most people just looked bewildered. Others realised what I was doing, and wore a pretty peeved expression as I continued on past them.</p>
<p>Much more satisfying than plain ol' getting hassled, or than getting ripped off. Of course, I would only advise doing this in a reasonably safe city, like Cusco. But all up, I highly recommend this free and devious activity.</p>
