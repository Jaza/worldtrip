<p>It's not much, but it's about all that England has to offer the world, as far as culinary delights go. And as with a <a href="/blog/cuppa-tea">cuppa tea</a>, no visit here would be complete without at least one serving of Fish 'n' Chips. Deep fried. Smothered in vinegar. And served for take-away in a white cardboard box. Almost makes me feel like I'm back home in Oz. Except that the guy cooking it was a Pakkie, instead of a Greek.</p>
