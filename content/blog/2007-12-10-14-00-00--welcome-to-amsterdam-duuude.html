<p>This evening I arrived in Amsterdam, Europe's most infamous city and one of its backpacker favourites. The train from Brussels was a quick 3 hours: it was pretty boring (Belgium is green and flat, Holland is green and even flatter), and I slept most of the way, tired after all my <a href="/blog/pop-into-brussels">walking around Brussels</a> in the morning. My first impression, upon walking into my hostel here (<a href="/blog/bobs-youth-hostel-amsterdam">Bob's</a>), is that this is a city of serious weed junkies. Everyone here is <em>totally stoned!</em> Further exploration of the city &mdash; going into the many nearby "cafés" &mdash; revealed that the stoned-ness is not limited to the basement of my hostel, either: it's absolutely everywhere. Since I don't smoke (anything), I might be hard-pressed finding something to do around here. Amsterdam is a junkies' and layabouts' paradise.</p>

<p>Soon after I'd checked in to Bob's, I met my friend <a href="/blog/jose-the-mexican">José</a>, and we went out to a few nearby pubs for some drinks. It seems that the pubs, at least, are not completely full of junkies: apparently you go to the pubs to drink, and to the cafés to smoke (or to eat cookies / mushrooms). It was a pretty relaxed evening: just a few drinks, and then a kebab (of which Amsterdam has no shortage), and then some more drinks back at the hostel, with some of "the serene ones".</p>
