<p>This evening we went <a href="/blog/a-night-at-the-augustiner-brau">to the Augustiner Bräu</a>, and we went there both to eat and to drink. They offer one selection of drink: beer. Good Bavarian beer, served strictly by the litre &mdash; no problems there, beer don't get much better than that. They also, basically, only offer one selection of food: pork. Ahahaha... <em>not</em> so good &mdash; not for the <em>Juden</em> and the pork-averse amongst us, anyways. But what choice did I have &mdash; G-d didn't command that thou shalt drink thy <em>stein</em> and otherwise starve, didst he now? So yes, I admit, I ate a bit of pork knuckle. And yes, I admit, it was surprisingly very tasty. I hope I'm remembering correctly, when my Sunday school teacher once told me that we Jews don't believe in hell.</p>
