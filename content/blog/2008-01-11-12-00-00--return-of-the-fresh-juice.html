<p>Back in <a href="/blog/south-america-checklist">South America</a>, I lived on the stuff. In "filled with artificial preservatives", "packaged and sealed three months ago and four countries away" Europe, it was nowhere to be seen. But now that I'm in Thailand, ever-present and ever-delicious fresh tropical juice is back! Banana, mango, coconut, orange, papaya and watermelon are just some of the varieties to be found on every street corner around here. Sadly, neither Ecuador's trademark <em>jugo de mora</em> ("blackberry juice") nor Brazil's sumptuous <a href="/blog/acai">açaí</a> are available &mdash; but the selection is nevertheless nothing to complain about. My "fresh juice twice or more daily" diet is once again in full swing, and life couldn't be better.</p>
