<p>This was yet another savoury street snack that <a href="/blog/marie-and-claire">Marie, Claire</a> and myself sampled at the <a href="/blog/pai-night-market">Pai night market</a> this evening. These pancakes are made primarily from ground corn and from coconut milk, with a bit of rice thrown in for good measure. Unlike the <a href="/blog/grilled-rice-pancake">grilled rice pancakes</a>, they're quite petite, and are generally sold by the dozen or half-dozen. There was a long wait for them this evening &mdash; despite the fact that they were cooking them in batches of about 100 &mdash; but our patience was well rewarded.</p>
