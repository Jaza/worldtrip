<p><a href="http://www.catshostel.com/">Cat's</a> is by far the most architecturally beautiful hostel I've ever stayed in: the enclosed central courtyard of the building is not only a chilled meeting and relaxation point; it's also a gorgeous work of painted Spanish arches and columns, exquisite marble flooring, and an ornate stained-glass ceiling. As well as the building, the hostel itself is also a great place: it has a lively bar with cheap drinks (including sangria); a great mix of fellow guests; and many conveniences nearby. My only complaint is with <a href="/blog/step-away-from-the-microwave">some of the staff</a>. Other than that, this is quite likely the best hostel to be found in Madrid.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> fairly quiet, and very secure (electronic key-operated doors and lockers &mdash; although some of the doors are hard to open). Most of the rooms also open onto the lovely courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> an international bunch, but most of them are the backpacker crowd that we're all looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> a bit inefficient (particularly at checking people in); and I also had <a href="/blog/step-away-from-the-microwave">a bad experience personally</a>, with one particular staff member. But they're generally friendly, and they're available 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> walking distance from Atocha central train station, from numerous good eating and nightlife places, and from Madrid's central square (Plaza del Sol).</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> free breakfast is good, if a bit small (1 cereal or croissant, 1 tea or coffee, 1 juice).</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 4 PCs in the downstairs bar, available for free for 20 minutes (they're very popular &mdash; you'll have to wait to use them). Alternatively, numerous â‚¬1/hr places can be found nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> pretty good, although they have the usual annoying "water saving" whack-and-whack-again taps. There are also plenty of bathrooms available.</p>
