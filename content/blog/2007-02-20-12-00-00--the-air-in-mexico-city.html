<p>The first thing I noticed about this city, when I started exploring it, is that the air is much cleaner than I thought it would be. I've always heard that the air pollution is among the worst in the world here, and so I was expecting the worst. But it's really not that bad.

<p>Maybe Sydney is just as polluted as Mexico City these days, so I was already used to the excessive smog. Or maybe Mexico City's air has improved in recent years, since the introduction of driving restrictions in parts of the city's centre.
</p>
<p>Anyway, for those of you that are curious, the air is quite breathable, and the sky quite blue, here in adorable Mexico City.</p>
