<p>The real part of our <a href="/blog/long-way-to-pilcopata">jungle tour</a> began this morning, with a visit to a farm and tourist retreat just outside Pilcopata. There, we met the most gorgeous <em>monito</em> ("little monkey") you ever saw. Don't know what his name was; but all he wanted to do was climb up all of us, wrap himself around our necks, and cuddle up to our heads forever. He took a particular liking to me (because of all my hair, I guess &mdash; something of a jungle growing on my head), which unfortunately <a href="/blog/me-and-monkeys-just-werent-meant-to-be">didn't turn out so well for me</a> later tonight. Also very fond of bananas, of course.</p>
