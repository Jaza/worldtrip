<p>Bolivia is an amazing country; but sadly, this is despite its culinary offerings. Fortunately, there are plenty of exotic <em>gringo</em> restaurants in La Paz, offering many of the fine foods that we crave from back home, and that give us a break from the positively ordinary local food of Bolivia. Last Thursday night, I dined on some delicious Beef Vindaloo at the <em>Star of India</em> restaurant. And today, I had some great Red Curry Thai Chicken at <em>Maphro On</em>.</p>

<p>First curry since I left Sydney. And boy, was it good! Thank G-d you can find Indian and Thai food (almost) everywhere in the world. Don't know what I'd do without it.</p>
