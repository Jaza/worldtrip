<p>After a difficult and lonely afternoon of separation &mdash; hell, it must have been almost 5 hours &mdash; this evening, we the <a href="/blog/padi-diving-course-begins">Open Water</a> crew had a grand and long-awaited reunion. It's been a while, but it was good to see everyone again :P. To celebrate, we drank the legendary <em>farang</em> beverage of southern Thailand: the bucket. Buckets come in two sizes: huge, and f$#%ing huge. Their contents generally consist of whisky, Red Bull and Coke; but they also come in numerous other, more exotic varieties (and, should you drink them on Ko Pha-Ngan of a full moon, less legal varieties :P). Tonight was my first bucket-drinking experience: and please G-d, may it be my biggest. Because if it gets any worse than it got tonight, then I'll be dead.</p>

<p><em>Le bucket, for monsieur. I believe that this particular bucket was of the "tropical delight" variety.</em></p>
<p>Our reunion kicked off in the bar area at <a href="/blog/bans-diving-resort-ko-tao">Ban's</a>, where we watched the video that they recorded of us <a href="/blog/lord-of-the-dive">this morning</a>, using a hi-tech underwater camcorder. The video was amazingly professional, and the footage of the underwater scenery superb; but none of us (except the instructors) looked at all flattering in the video (myself least of all), and the price of a take-home DVD copy was 2,000B (app. AUD$70), which I considered to be a major ripoff.</p>
<p>Once the video had finished (they played it on the enormous digital projector in the bar), it was time for the royal VIP treatment: the 15 of us were seated at a super-long table, that occupied half the restaurant; and we enjoyed a delicious dinner, of which the entr√©es were on the house. It was a grand, group feast: but it was just the start of the night's festivities.</p>

<p><em>Tonight was our turn at the "congratz on finishing your Open Water" table.</em></p>
<p>The bucket-drinking commenced at Ban's, where all of us were given a special stamp, that entitled us to 50B off any bucket. Who could resist such a promotion? <a href="/blog/adam-from-dublin">Adam</a> and I shared 2 of the bastards. We got through them without any problems, and I felt OK after we'd finished slurping on them. However, they were bloody strong &mdash; as evidenced by my sudden, irresistable urge to commence break-dancing in the middle of the bar.</p>

<p><em>Sorry... I do that sometimes.</em></p>
<p>As the night progressed, we said goodbye to the bar at Ban's. Rumour had it that <a href="/blog/ber-the-diver">Ber</a>'s bar, the Hippo bar, was kicking off with a big party tonight. Ber himself assured us of the fact, and strongly persuaded us to follow him over to the joint: and so off we went, to see what all the fuss was about.</p>

<p><em>Party continues at the Hippo bar.</em></p>
<p>From there on, all I can tell you for sure is that I arrived at the Hippo bar, that I had one more drink (not a bucket, just a small Coke mixer), and that I have no memory of the night whatsoever from that point on. For the third time <a href="/blog/what-the-hell-happened-last-night">during</a> this <a href="/blog/kwak-and-i-forget-the-rest">trip</a> &mdash; and in my life &mdash; over-intoxication stole several hours of my life's memory. According to my friends who were there to witness it, what happened included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I passed out</li>
<li>I vomited on myself and others (Lucy later described it as "projectile vomit")</li>
<li>Someone dragged me to some cushions in the corner of the bar, where I lay unconscious for several hours</li>
<li><a href="/blog/alex-and-caroline">Alex</a> was an incredible friend, and literally carried me home (we've shared a room at Ban's for the past 4 nights), where I slept soundly until morning</li>
</ul>
<p>This was the third time that I've lost my memory and been a silly git due to over-drinking. But it's the first time that I've collapsed and passed out from over-drinking &mdash; never before has alcohol hit me quite that badly. I guess it must have been the combination of the hot weather, the strong drinks, the light Thai dinner, and (most of all) the residual weakening effect of 2 days of diving. So never mind: <em>one tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor.</em> Beware the crazy substance that is Sang Som whisky, or you too may discover that it's more like: <em>one <strong>bucket</strong>, two bucket, three bucket, floor.</em></p>
