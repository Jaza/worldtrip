<p>I just received the shocking news this afternoon, about <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/24/2145853.htm">what happened to Dave</a>. It happened on the 23<sup>rd</sup>, but it's taken some time for the news to spread, and finally to reach me. I don't want to say too much about it here, except that Dave was one of my best friends, and that like so many others I will miss him dearly. I wish I could make it to his funeral, which will be on Fri 1 Feb, but at that time I'll still be here in Thailand. I have no doubt, at least, that there will be no shortage of Dave's other numerous friends, family and colleagues in attendance, all to pay their respects. My deepest condolences to Ruth, Leslie and Debbie &mdash; Dave's mother, father and sister &mdash; as well as to Jo and Rountree, who were closer to Dave and who knew him better than most, and for whom I know the pain will be particularly strong. Sydney, <a href="http://www.aujs.com.au/">AUJS</a>, <a href="http://www.khs.nsw.edu.au/">high school</a> reunions, skiing, chess, Frisbee, <a href="http://jazasworld.greenash.net.au/library/books/ice-station">action novels</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldenEye_007">playing Nintendo</a>, talking loud, and losing count of girlfriends &mdash; these things simply won't be the same without you, mate.</p>
