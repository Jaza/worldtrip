<p>Ran into <a href="/blog/london-dutch-couple">the Dutch couple</a> here at <a href="/blog/generator-hostel-london">The Generator</a> this evening, so I went to the bar and shared a few drinks with them. Now, I've been to plenty of hostel bars on my trip, so I kinda know what to expect these days &mdash; but the Generator bar surprised and disappointed me. Not your usual friendly crowd at all. Unlike all the "gringo bars" down in South America, this place is more like being back home in Sydney: that is, clicky and unfriendly. None of the usual "hey dude, where you from" greetings &mdash; in this place, you stick with your little group, or you get out. Plus, the music and the DJ'ing were up s$%# creek. And the drinks were hardly the cheapest I've ever slurped on this trip. I hope that this isn't how all hostels in Europe are: if it is, then Europe is going to really, seriously suck.</p>

<p>The Dutch couple told me something really funny thing this evening, at the bar. They explained how it took them longer to get the tube from Heathrow airport to Central London, than it took them to fly from Amsterdam to Heathrow! Europe's a crazy old place: it's quicker to get from one country to another, than it is to get from one side of a city to another.</p>
