<p>I continued celebrating <em>Rosh Hashanah</em> (Jewish New Year) today, with first day <em>shul</em> services and communal meals. I spent the day at "Chabad La Metayel" (run by my mate <a href="/blog/menachem">Menachem</a>), which is conveniently located about 3 blocks from <a href="/blog/hostel-clan-ba">Hostel Clan</a>, just a 10-minute walk down the street for me. Unfortunately, when I got there (at 11am) the service still hadn't started; and we had to sit and wait until 1pm, when we finally got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyan"><em>minyan</em></a> and could start doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_services"><em>shacharit</em></a>. This forced the rabbi to jam the service into a mere 2 hours, at the expense of all singing, and through some serious (true Chabad-style) rapid-fire prayer. However, we still managed to fit in all the soundings of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shofar"><em>shofar</em></a>, which ushered in the New Year with a bang.</p>
<p>After the much-delayed and super-condensed "morning" service, most of us hung around for a nice, long, New Year lunch. Unlike <a href="/blog/first-night-rosh-hashanah-in-ba">last night's enormous dinner</a>, this afternoon was a cosy affair: about 10 of us at one little table in the <em>shul</em> hall. More <em>challah</em>, hommus, chicken, rice, and fruit salad (hey, it's kosher catering &mdash; even in Argentina, that's the only food they know). More singing, discussing, and shmoozing. Once again, I was very much the odd one out, with my being non-Israeli and non-Hebrew-speaking and all.</p>
<p>We finished up the lunch, and then went on a long walk down to the <em>Rio de la Plata</em> ("River Plate" &mdash; BA's waterfront), to do <em>taschlich</em>. Menachem said a few prayers when we got there &mdash; but he surprised me by not throwing any bread crumbs into the water; apparently, it's "not required" and "not a Chabad custom". Well, I never knew that before: I always kinda thought of the bread-throwing as the main activity that constituted <em>taschlich</em>. But apparently, you can throw your sins into the water spiritually, without using the physical metaphor as an aid.</p>
<p>It was getting dark: but the eating and praying for the day was not yet done! Our (equally long) walk back to the <em>shul</em> was followed by <em>mincha</em> and <em>ma'ariv</em> prayers, and then by yet more eating! We were served pretty much the same stuff for dinner (yep, more chicken) &mdash; and I'd already eaten so much today, I could hardly stomach eating more. That's a good sign that I'm celebrating a Jewish festival properly :P. I'll be coming back tomorrow, to do more of the same: my soul needs some more nourishment; and they clearly need all the help they can get, in making a <em>minyan</em>.</p>
