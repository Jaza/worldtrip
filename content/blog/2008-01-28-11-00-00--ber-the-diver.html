<p>Ber's an English bloke, and he's another one of the devoted, dedicated and &mdash; let's face it &mdash; addicted diving instructors at <a href="/blog/bans-diving-resort-ko-tao">Ban's</a>, here in Ko Tao. As well as being a full-time instructor, Ber is also now the proud owner of the <a href="/blog/one-two-three-bucket-floor">Hippo bar</a>, which is just off from the main drag of Sairee. Ber took me for my <a href="/blog/lord-of-the-dive">second round of dives</a> today; and like his colleague <a href="/blog/flav-the-diver">Flav</a>, he did a great job of showing me around below the surface.</p>
