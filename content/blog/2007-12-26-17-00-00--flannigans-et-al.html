<p><em>Crowded at Flannigans.</em></p>
<p>Flannigans prides itself on possessing one of only two public pool tables in all of Kitzbühel. On some nights they have (reasonably good) live bands playing; but tonight, it was just your standard selection of chirpy stereo rock music. Of the many people that I met here this evening, two in particular stand out: two very good-looking blonde sisters, who claim to be Aussies (from Wagga Wagga, no less &mdash; doesn't get more Aussie than that), but who look like the most German-complexion young lasses I've ever seen. Their accents didn't sound particularly Aussie, either &mdash; I have my doubts.</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/nikolas-and-viktor">Viktor</a> attempts to chat up the allegedly Aussie girl (don't you agree that she looks like her name's Helga, and like she's a Bavarian farm girl?).</em></p>
<p>Tonight ended up being a biiig night: one of the biggest I've had so far in Europe. As far as drinking goes: first there were the <a href="/blog/hammerschlagen">free Hammerschlagen Jägers</a>; then there were some beers over dinner; then some more Jägers at <a href="/blog/snowbunnys-hostel-kitzbuhel">Snowbunnys</a>; then more Jäger and more beer at Flannigans; and then we went to a club called <a href="http://www.highways.at/">Highways</a>, where there was lots of dancing, and where the drinking still continued. By the time we were done at Highways, I was completely wasted; the dancing there, and the walk back home, are a little hazy in my mind. But it was all jolly good fun &mdash; Kitzbühel really does know how to <em>après-ski</em>.</p>
