<p>One of the tastiest side dishes in the world of Thai cuisine is the nation's vegetarian <a href="http://www.templeofthai.com/recipes/spring_rolls.php">spring rolls</a>. Preparation for this dish involves making the paste that is the roll's filling: this consists of various vegetables, noodles, sauces and spices, which are all mushed together. The paste is then rolled up inside sheets of rice paper, and deep fried until cooked and crunchy. Best served hot, and best dipped in fresh sweet-chili sauce. This was yet another one of the mouth-watering foods that I made during <a href="/blog/cooking-in-chiang-mai">today's cooking class</a>.</p>
