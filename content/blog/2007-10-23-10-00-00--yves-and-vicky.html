<p>This lovely Canadian couple are, they claim, from the French-speaking park of Ottawa. They've just finished a few weeks down in Portugal (which they report as being cheap and sunny &mdash; not a bad combo), and are now on their way back home. I did some <a href="/blog/the-london-guide-yer-bloody-self-tour">touring around London</a> with them today, to enjoy the sights and the sun of the city while they lasted.</p>
