<p>So far in my travels, I haven't really done the whole buy-groceries-and-eat-frugal thing. It's been cheap as it is, eating at restaurants and at hot-food street stalls. But with Pesach coming, I decided that I have to stock up on some unleavened supplies to keep me going for the next week.

<p>Alas, they don't seem to sell Matzah at the stores anywhere around here. But I was able to get enough other stuff to keep me nourished. Fruit, cheese, cans of tuna, and eggs. And plenty of bottled water as well.</p>
<p>One really strange thing about the cash registers at the supermarkets (and other stores) here in Lima: they calculate the price in <em>soles</em>, and in US dollars! Unlike in Mexico &mdash; where none but the most touristy places accept dollars &mdash; everyone is more than happy to accept either local or <em>gringo</em> currency around here. Apparently, this is a hangover from the hyper-inflation period of 10-15 years ago, when <em>soles</em> became worthless, and dollars became the <em>de facto</em> preferred currency.</p>
