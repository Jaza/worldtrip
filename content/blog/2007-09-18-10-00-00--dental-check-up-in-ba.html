<p>I really have no excuse for not going to the dentist more often. My uncle back home is a dentist, so I could go virtually for free in Sydney, any time I like. In fact, I think I have about 4 dentists in the extended family (most of them being various "types of uncles"). But when I'm back home, I just don't get around to it. So I figure that a free week in BA is about as good a time as I could ever get, for paying a visit. I was planning to go in Peru, or in Ecuador, but didn't get around to it while I was up there, either.</p>
<p>Anyway, all went about as well as can be expected. Got a check-up, and got some thorough cleaning and polishing done on my teeth. Turns out that I have one cavity: it's not that big yet, but it's only getting bigger. So I have to come back on Thursday, to get it filled in. Apart from that, my teeth are pretty much as shiny and twinkly (and healthy) as can be.</p>
