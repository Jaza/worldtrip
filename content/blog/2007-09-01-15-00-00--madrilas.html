<p>Madrilas is the gorgeous dog that lives at <a href="/blog/patanuk-hostel-bariloche">Patanuk</a>. Not sure exactly what breed he is &mdash; he's from the Pyrenees in Spain, but I don't think he's a Great Pyrenees &mdash; but he's big, grey, shaggy, very gentle, and less than a year old. Sylvia brought him over from Spain about 6 months ago, when he was a smaller puppy. He'll play with anyone who's got time for him, and his favourite hobby is falling asleep in the middle of where everyone has to walk, forcing them to jump over him.</p>
