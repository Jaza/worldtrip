<p>Collin is a Scotsman who's been living in Spain for the past 3 years, where he works as a high-school English teacher. I met Collin on my <a href="/blog/frankfurt-to-madrid-with-ryanair">flight to Madrid</a> this morning, while sitting in the departure lounge during the delay. Collin says that he flies with <a href="http://www.ryanair.com/">Ryanair</a> all the time, but he admits: "I hate them, they're absolute bastards... I just can't stop booking flights with them, 'cause they're so damn cheap!" Good to have some company, amidst the never-ending delays and the chaotic scene that was this morning's flight.</p>
