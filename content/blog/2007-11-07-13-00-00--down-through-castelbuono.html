<p>This morning's <a href="/blog/castello-geraci-siculo">ride to Geraci Siculo</a> was a bit tough; but after that, the rest of the day was a breeze. Yesterday, I slogged through the <a href="/blog/the-nebrodi-climb">long uphill climb into the Nebrodi</a> mountains; and today, all that paid off, because it was a long downhill cruise through the neighbouring Madonie mountains, and back to the Sicilian north coast. Not only was the rest of the day completely downhill &mdash; it was also warm, sunny, and very pleasant scenery-wise. Like the Nebrodi, Le Madonie is also a pristine and protected area of Sicily; and it also boasts rolling farmland, lush forests, and charming mountain towns. I passed through Castelbuono &mdash; one such town &mdash; at lunchtime today; when I sat down at a cafe on the main drag there, one of the locals was even generous enough to buy me an espresso! Nothing like some warm, rural Sicilian hospitality, eh?</p>

<p>Like its neighbour higher in the mountains (Geraci Siculo), Castelbuono is a charming and rustic place, and its local residents are very friendly. It also boasts a big old castle (and not such a ruined one, either); although I didn't check out the castle up close, I just saw it while I was riding into town. I stopped in Castelbuono for some food and some coffee, before continuing north out of the mountains, towards the coastal resort town of Cefal√π, where I called it a day and had a relaxing evening.</p>
