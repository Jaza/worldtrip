<p>Cute little fella, innee? He's got little velcro dots sewn into his hands, so that you can wrap his arms around your neck, and let him "hold on" and dangle there for a while. He also makes a horrible screeching monkey noise, if you squeeze him hard enough &mdash; this will be sure to induce plenty of headaches upon all who hear it. Picked the monkey up in <a href="/blog/khao-san-road">Khao San Road</a> today, although there is (naturally) nothing Thai about him &mdash; but a quick snip of the 'ol label, and nobody ever need know his humble "made in China" origins. As well as being a cuddly teddy, I believe this monkey would also serve well as a long-hanging wall decoration.</p>
