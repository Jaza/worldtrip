<p>Today's cycling was still <a href="/blog/strong-wind-in-mafialand">very windy</a>, and quite cold. But it was very short, and it was downhill virtually the whole way. From last night's <a href="/blog/a-field-near-corleone">field near Corleone</a>, it only took me about 2&frac12; hours this morning to ride north out of the mountainous Mafia heartland; and down to Palermo, the capital and largest city of Sicily. It took a little while to get into the centre of Palermo &mdash; plus, I was forced for the first time to cycle on the <em>autostrada</em> (freeway), as there seemed to be no other way to reach the city centre (I don't think bicycles are allowed on the <em>autostrada</em> &mdash; but what the hell). Seeing as it was such a quick ride to the capital, I guess I can spend the rest of the day relaxing and recovering from my rugged time in the hills.</p>
