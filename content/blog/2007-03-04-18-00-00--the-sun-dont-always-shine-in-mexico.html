<p>Tonight I saw my first-ever Mexican rain. After 2 weeks straight of endless, relentless sunshine, I was starting to think that "the sun always shines in Mexico". But now, I'm afraid to say that it ain't so. Even in beautiful <em>Playa</em>, on the dance floor of <em>The Blue Parrot</em>, things can get washed out.</p>
<p>A dazzling, clear-blue morning gave way to a dark, ominous afternoon, which has in turn given way to a wet, dreary Sunday night. This isn't how I'll remember <em>Playa</em>. But it still sucks.</p>
