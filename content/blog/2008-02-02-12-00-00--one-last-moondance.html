<p>Today was my third and final day on the idyllic <a href="/blog/moondance-beach">Moondance beach</a>, and it was no different from the days before it.

<p>Today was my third and final day on the idyllic <a href="/blog/moondance-beach">Moondance beach</a>, and it was no different from the days before it. More of relaxing, more of occasionally taking a dip, and more of doing very little. I found <a href="/blog/the-only-gay-on-the-island">Robert</a> in his usual nesting-spot, sprawled on the sand next to a big rock; and in the afternoon, we were joined by a friend of Robert's, who's just arrived direct from Austria (and who's not gay &mdash; although he does run a bar in Graz), as well as by <a href="/blog/iris-and-andrea">Iris and Andrea</a>.</p>
<p>It was a long and lazy day, and we followed it with a long and lazy evening, spent sipping a few drinks at the hippie beach bar next-door to my pad. I was surrounded by Austrians &mdash; <strong>four</strong> of them now! &mdash; but they're a friendly bunch, and I survived their regular Deutsch interludes in the conversation. There was some cool fire juggling on the beach; and everyone seemed to be getting stoned except me. Hey, if I made it through South America, and if I made it through Amsterdam, then I'm bloody well going to make it through Thailand without smoking any weed. Anyway, I was feeling pretty mellow throughout the evening: no doubt I partook in plenty of "passive weed smoking", just by sitting next to everyone for so long.</p>
