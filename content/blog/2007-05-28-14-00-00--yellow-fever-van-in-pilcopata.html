<p>This evening in Pilcopata, we were wandering around the main (and only) street of town, when we saw an <em>ambulancia</em> parked in the middle of the road, lights blazing and loudspeakers blaring. The driver was saying through the loudspeaker that they were offering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever">Yellow fever</a> vaccinations to the locals, on-the-spot, and 100% free of charge. As Pilcopata is on the edge of the Peruvian jungle, I guess it is technically a Yellow fever endemic area. Great to see that they're making a real effort to try and curb the prevalence of this illness, and to protect the locals from contracting it.</p>

<p>The <em>ambulancia</em> appeared to be there purely on behalf of (and funded by) the Peruvian government. However, I find it hard to believe that the government is really conducting this program out of the goodness of their heart. They have a track record of consistently neglecting and under-funding the communities in the jungle, and I don't see why they'd suddenly change their ways. No doubt, they're receiving funding from some charity group such as the <a href="http://www.who.int/">UN WHO</a>. Anyway, regardless of who's paying for it, it's great that it's happening. I, of course, already got my Yellow fever vaccination before I left Australia, so I didn't need to get a shot here; but plenty of locals were going up to the van and getting immunised.</p>
