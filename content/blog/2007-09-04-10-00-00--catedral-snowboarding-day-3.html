<p>Another big day on the mountain, for a small and fledgling newbie snowboarder to keep tackling the terrain. Today was a very white day: it was snowing all day &mdash; not just on the mountain, but also in Catedral's alpine village; and even back in town as well, in Bariloche! Snow is fine by me, of course &mdash; unlike rain, it doesn't make you wet, and it makes the ground-cover better rather than worse (plus it looks beautiful when it's falling) &mdash; although a post-snowfall clear blue day is certainly better. I kept practising, kept venturing further up the chairlifts (and back down the slopes), and kept stacking it every five seconds. But hey, still getting there, little by little.</p>

<p>My instructor yesterday &mdash; Mart√≠n from the Catedral Mountain school &mdash; told me that I'd be able to come back today, and to get another group lesson / board hire combo for the day. Well, like I said, he's a nice guy, but his employers really aren't. No luck with the lessons today: there was nobody else to go for a group lesson with; and Catedral Mountain refused to give me another "private group lesson", claiming that they only did it yesterday because they were anticipating more people, and that giving me a private lesson at group price is "a financial loss for them" (BULL$#%&amp;!). So I'm officially giving up on my endeavours to procure more lessons: it's way more trouble than it's worth, and I don't want to deal with the stress and aggravation of it anymore. I'm on holiday, for G-d's sake &mdash; I don't need all that hassle. And anyway, I think I've been taught enough, to get by for the rest of the week just by continuing to practice.</p>
