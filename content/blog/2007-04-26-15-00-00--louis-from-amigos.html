<p>Louis is a French computer science student, who's on an overseas <em>"work placement"</em> of sorts (the voluntary sort) at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>. His main task at Amigos is to build them a new <a href="http://www.spanishcusco.com/">web site</a>, which he's doing using the very cool system <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. He hasn't got much experience with web design or development, and he hasn't been given many resources (he has his own laptop, but no Internet at Amigos!); but he's done a good job so far. He's also a juggler, a fearless drinker, and a great part of the Amigos team.</p>
