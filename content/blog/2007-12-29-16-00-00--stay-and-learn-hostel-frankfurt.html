<p>Hostels really don't get much more conveniently located than <a href="http://www.room-frankfurt.de/">Stay and Learn</a>: it's across the road from the train station! It seems that the owners of this hostel are prepared to admit the truth: Frankfurt's a big boring city, and most people only come here in order to make some kind of transport connection (generally a flight). I guess that, due to its name, many people also stay in Frankfurt in order to learn some German &mdash; because there's nothing else to do here :P. Considering that it's in big commercial Frankfurt, I found Stay and Learn to be surprisingly fun and colourful, for the one night that I was here. The common room upstairs is very friendly, and the free all-you-can-eat dinner (on some nights) is not to be missed.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> usual German high standard &mdash; quiet, clean and comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> friendly and international bunch of backpackers can be found here.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> also very friendly &mdash; and available 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> across the road from the train station. The area around the hostel is a red-light district: as well as sex shops, they also have handy junk shops everywhere, and plenty of cheap food.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> free dinner on some nights of the week; the Saturday night pasta is excellent. They also have free breakfast, but sadly I had to leave too early to try it.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> numerous PCs available for â‚¬0.90/hr; this is the first hostel I've stayed at where the hostel Internet is actually cheaper than the cafe Internet down the road!</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> didn't have time to try it &mdash; but the ensuite shower and bathroom in my dorm looked very nice.</p>
