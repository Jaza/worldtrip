<p>Seeing that <a href="/blog/drinks-at-the-italian-pad">yesterday evening</a>, I discovered my foot was painfully injured &mdash; and that this morning it wasn't feeling much better &mdash; today I decided to just take it easy, and to relax on the beach in Abraão, with a book and a sandy towel. I didn't have much choice, really: I could barely walk! So it was a bit of gentle wandering today, and a bit of eating; but mostly, just sitting on the sand and reading. Nice weather today &mdash; those clouds have all but cleared up &mdash; so I had plenty of sun to keep me company. Well, it was nice to unwind and to take it easy anyhow &mdash; but hopefully the 'ol foot will heal up soon, so that I can be back in action for the end of my time here in Brazil.</p>
