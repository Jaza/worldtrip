<p>This place is nice, but it has some serious shortcomings. It's definitely not the partygoer's hostel: after 10pm (yes, 10pm &mdash; ridiculously early!), they lock the front door, and you have to bang on it for up to a minute to get back in. The crowd was nice when I was here; but I heard that the crowd is much better over at the Backpacker's Hostel. I should have gone there instead; although I was happy with somewhere a bit quieter, I still like a good vibrant community. This time, <em>Lonely Planet</em> recommendations, you let me down.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> a bit crowded, but nice and clean.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> nice crowd, but a bit subdued by the venue.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> most are friendly, some are English-speaking.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> fairly close to everything.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> decent breakfast &mdash; but no seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 2 PCs free (average quality).</p>
