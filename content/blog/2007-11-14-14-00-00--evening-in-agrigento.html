<p>Seeing that I've done a record three nights straight of rough camping &mdash; and that I'm in a big city with plenty of eating and accommodation options &mdash; the time has come for a night of splurging. After a thorough <a href="/blog/valle-dei-templi-ruins">exploration of the Valle dei Templi</a> this afternoon, I rode into the city of Agrigento, and found myself a nice budget hotel in which to spend the night. I was looking for a B&amp;B &mdash; it seems that around here, hotels and B&amp;Bs are virtually the same price-wise, and have the same offerings, except that one includes a meal and one doesn't &mdash; but the hotel was the best I could find. Also, Agrigento is a nice enough place, but it seems that the ruins in the valley are the main attraction &mdash; the city itself is nothing special, and doesn't warrant more than a night's stay.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was quite a successful night: I managed to find a place where I could backup my photos onto CD (which was urgent, as my memory card is almost full, and it needs emptying). I grabbed some nice <em>panini</em> and hot dogs for dinner. I found a supermarket for some grocery stocking-up. I feasted on a delicious <em>gelato</em>. And I got one hell of a solid night's sleep. Plus, it was a very good night to be snug inside a hotel room, as there was quite a downpour of rain once it got dark; wouldn't have been so fun in a tent tonight.</p>
