<p>Since there's <a href="/blog/joyride-cafe-sucre">absolutely nothing to do in Sucre</a>, we decided to get out of here today, after only one day here. On the bus to Potosí today, there was a guy selling little stapled-together books to his fellow passengers. <a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a> and I weren't interested in any of his offerings; but I was in a position, smack-bang in the middle of the bus, where I ended up passing all the sold books down the bus, and passing all the money and change up and down, between salesman and buyers. As a reward for my services, the guy gave me a free little comic book of crude, raunchy Bolivian jokes. Bit more Spanish bedtime reading.</p>
