<p>One of the things I <a href="/blog/mexico-the-big-wrapup">resolved to do after leaving Mexico</a> (as you may recall) was to waste less money, and to sacrifice less brain cells, on alcohol. I figured that going on adventures, and getting out of the big cities, would make this easier. Well, it hasn't quite turned out that way, on the <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">Salkantay hike</a>. I've been on a mission of virtual abstinence from alcohol the whole trip. But absolutely everyone else in my group &mdash; especially <a href="/blog/the-belgian-front">the Belgian Front</a> &mdash; has had the exact opposite mission. And they've taken it upon themselves &mdash; <em>"for your own good"</em> &mdash; to render my mission a failure. They seem to have succeeded.</p>

<p>I haven't bought a drop of alcohol the entire hike. But everyone else has been buying family-size Cusque√±as by the truck-load, every night (yes, they sold them at the campsites!), and filling my glass before I have a chance to so much as sneeze. It's ridiculous! I'm trying to have a nice, healthy, sober few days with nature, and nobody else wants a bar of it. Piece of advice for anyone planning on an alcohol-free trip in the wild: leave the Pommies, <a href="/blog/dave-from-ireland">the Irish</a>, the Norweigians, the Argentinians, the Germans, and (more so than anyone else) those damn Belgians back home!</p>
