<p>Anyone who's ever visited Bangkok will recognise this ever-present, oh-so-classic sentence. It's the call of the city's extremely numerous <em>tuk-tuk</em> drivers, who endeavour to solicit a few <em>baht</em> from whoever wanders their way, and who seem to have a deep-rooted belief that it is nobody's God-given right to actually <em>walk</em> anywhere &mdash; everyone should be getting a lift, and <em>they</em> should be the ones providing said lifts. <em>Tuk-tuks</em> also seem to genuinely believe that they know better than you "where you go": as far as they're concerned, any and every male <em>farang</em>, at any time of the day, has a desperate desire to be driven to see "pretty ladies" and to get "nice massage"; and as such, it is to such venues that they will endlessly offer you a ride. In <a href="/blog/khao-san-road">Khao San Road</a>, the <em>tuk-tuks</em> are at their thickest, and a swarm of flies does a worse job of buzzing and hovering &mdash; after the first few offers, they become little more than an annoying buzz in your ears.</p>
