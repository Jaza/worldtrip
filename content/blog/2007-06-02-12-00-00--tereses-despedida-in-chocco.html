Terese has been teaching English in Chocco (with <a href="http://hampy.org/">Hampy</a>) for the past two months or so (as well as partying and drinking like crazy every single night in Cusco, like a good Irish girl should); but now, she's finally finishing up and going back home. She will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>The thank-you ceremony and <em>despedida</em> took place in the church-hall-slash-English-school in Chocco. Most of the <a href="/blog/pilcopata-jungle-trip-the-wrapup">jungle trip</a> crew were there: myself, <a href="/blog/ashley-from-hampy">Ashley</a>, <a href="/blog/stephan-from-hampy">Stephan</a>, and <a href="/blog/wil-from-amigos">Wil</a>; as well as <a href="/blog/jorge-from-hampy">Jorge</a> (and his brother, Sandro), and a tonne of the local kids that Terese has been teaching. There was a nice little ceremony, where we said an official thank-you to Terese, and gave her a certificate for all the hard (and unpaid) work that she's done. Then, it was time to eat, and to party!
