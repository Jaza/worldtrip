<p>Having got back from my <a href="/blog/apurimac-rafting-trip-the-finale">three-day rafting trip</a> yesterday, I was in Cusco today, in time for <a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a>'s birthday. In honour of the occasion, Jesus held a grand old <em>fiesta</em> this evening, which began with copious amounts of beverages in his apartment (none of which I could drink, due to my <a href="/blog/doctor-visit-in-cusco">still being on antibiotics</a>), and which continued with dancing (and more beverages) out on the town. A great celebration for my friend and school principal, with many of his oldest and dearest friends coming from far and wide, to be there and to celebrate with him.</p>

<p>Having got back from my <a href="/blog/apurimac-rafting-trip-the-finale">three-day rafting trip</a> yesterday, I was in Cusco today, in time for <a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a>'s birthday.

<p>Despite our <a href="/blog/finished-with-the-amigos-web-site">lack of success in working together</a>, it looks like Jesus and I will always be friends, and will always at least be able to party together (although I'll never be able to drink like Jesus does!). I got Jesus some DVDs for his birthday (from <a href="/blog/el-molino">El Molino</a>, of course) &mdash; interesting and philosophical, just the way he likes them. I also had the chance to meet Jesus's crazy friend <a href="/blog/jacinta-from-amigos">Jacinta</a> at the party this evening, which by itself made the event worthwhile.</p>
