<p>Walking into DrupalCon felt &mdash; for a die-hard fan like myself, at least &mdash; like walking into the cast of <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">my favourite movie of all time</a>. All these people whose avatar photos I've seen, whose blogs I've read, whose patches I've reviewed, whose criticism I've received, and whose IRC handles I've chatted with (all for the past 2 years) &mdash; all of them suddenly, in a very surreal way, came to life before my very eyes. So I finally have proof that this whole Drupal thing is not <a href="http://www.lpconline.com/Nigerian_fraud_letter_scam.html">a great big online hoax</a>: as I always believed, other Drupal people do actually exist in real life!</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the amazing and crazy people that I finally managed to meet today:

<p>This is just a handful of the famous people that I met at DrupalCon. For those of you that I missed out, sorry &mdash; it's probably because I couldn't find a photo of you in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/oscms2007">the Flickr pool</a>, or because you just slipped my memory (that's due to my memory being crap, not due to you being unmemorable, trust me).</p>
