<p>Two giant, beer-swilling young physiotherapists from Melbourne. These guys were with us on the <a href="/blog/pampas-trip-heading-out">pampas trip</a> this week, and they proved to provide us with constant entertainment. Always doing such classic Aussie things as randomly jumping in the river and going for a swim; catching small animals and insects; and not being able to fit in their boots. They also found a baby anaconda, all by themselves.</p>
