<p>Cusco is the heartland of the ancient Incan Empire, and of the Quechuan race; and as such, the majority of people in the Cusco area still speak Quechua as their native tongue. When I got a taxi across town today, my driver decided to share a bit of basic Quechua with me. It's a bloody hard language, and I couldn't really remember any of the phrases he taught me.

<p>Cusco is the heartland of the ancient Incan Empire, and of the Quechuan race; and as such, the majority of people in the Cusco area still speak Quechua as their native tongue. When I got a taxi across town today, my driver decided to share a bit of basic Quechua with me. It's a bloody hard language, and I couldn't really remember any of the phrases he taught me. But at least he was trying to teach me, and I was trying to learn.</p>
<p>With the help of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Quechua-Phrasebook-Serafin-Coronel-Molina/dp/1864503815">Lonely Planet Quechua Phrasebook</a>, this is what the driver was trying to teach me:</p>
<p><em>English:</em> Hello.<br />
<em>Español:</em> Hola.<br />
<em>Quechua:</em> Rimay kullayki.</p>
<p><em>English:</em> How are you?<br />
<em>Español:</em> ¿Como estás?<br />
<em>Quechua:</em> ¿Imaynallan kashanki?</p>
<p><em>English:</em> Fine.<br />
<em>Español:</em> Bien.<br />
<em>Quechua:</em> Allillanmí.</p>
<p><em>English:</em> Goodbye.<br />
<em>Español:</em> Adiós.<br />
<em>Quechua:</em> Tupananchiskama.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> written Quechua (generally) follows the pronunciation rules of written Spanish, e.g. a double "l" (i.e. "ll") is pronounced with an English "y" sound.</p>
<p>Well, after this experience, it's clear to me that Quechua is a pretty damn weird and challenging language. I'm busy enough learning Spanish; I think I'll stick to one language at a time.</p>
