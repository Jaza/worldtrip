<p>Weißwürste (lit: "white sausage") is a Bavarian specialty: it's made mainly from minced veal, and stuffed into a skin of pork casing. It's eaten without the skin &mdash; you either suck the mince out of the skin, or you slice the sausage in half &mdash; and is usually served with beer (and often with a big baked pretzel). I tried weißwürste on <a href="/blog/ozzie-tour-of-munich">my tour of Munich</a> today, in the Viktualienmarkt beer garden. Sadly, I did not adhere to the Bavarian tradition of eating the dish before noon: I missed the deadline by about an hour. Tasted great nonetheless.</p>
