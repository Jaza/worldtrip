<p>There aren't nearly as many Aussies here at <a href="/blog/kabul-hostel-barcelona">Kabul</a> as there are <a href="/blog/brasileros-of-barcelona">Brazilians</a>, but there are still quite a few. The two that I got to know the best were Deanna and Jenny, two Brisbane girls with whom I'm sharing my dorm room. Deanna and Jenny both have a biting sense of humour, and they're both here for a short vacation, before they do "that Aussie thing" and head over to England in search of some long-term work. There are also a few other random Aussie guys staying here, and I've seen them down at the bar on most nights. There are some nationalities where no matter where you go, you're never alone &mdash; and mine is sure as hell one of them.</p>
