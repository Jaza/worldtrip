<p>After getting through <a href="/blog/flying-out-of-ecuador">my two connecting flights</a> yesterday evening, from Quito to Santiago, I arrived <a href="/blog/chile-quick-northern-wrapup">back</a> in Chile at about 2am this morning. Let's just say that I had a bit of a "rough" welcome. They let me into the country in the end: but not until I'd paid yet another <em>gringo</em> tax. Which, upon stepping off the plane, I quite literally could not afford.</p>
<p>So I arrive in the airport, I walk through the passageways, and I get to the line for immigration. After waiting in line for a few minutes, I get served by one of the customs police. He looks in my passport, and frowns back at me.</p>
<p><em>"So you're Australian?"</em> he asks.</p>
<p><em>"Yeah, that's right"</em>, I reply.</p>
<p><em>"Well, you have to go and pay the reciprocity tax"</em>, he says, pointing back in the direction that I came.</p>
<p><em>"Huh? How much is that?"</em> I ask.</p>
<p><em>"I don't know &mdash; just go and pay it!"</em> he insists.</p>
<p>So off I go to another desk, to pay the "reciprocity tax". This is exactly what its name implies: Chile charges an entry tax to people from certain countries, purely because those countries charge its citizens a similar entry fee when they visit. Turns out that for Australians, the entry fee is $56. It has to be paid in cash (or with a credit card), in US dollars, upon arrival.</p>
<p>Also turned out that I only had 30 US dollars, in cash, upon arrival. And no credit card. And they don't take <abbr title="Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale">EFTPOS</abbr>. And there are no <abbr title="Automatic Teller Machine">ATM</abbr>s inside the immigration gates. So I was in a right little quandary &mdash; what you might call a <em>catch-22</em>. Couldn't enter the country without paying the tax. And couldn't enter the country to get the money for paying the tax, until I'd paid the tax.</p>
<p>Took a little while, and nobody was happy about it (it was, after all, 2am): but eventually, I managed to get one of the customs policemen to escort me out to the front of the airport, where I could withdraw some Chilean pesos out of an ATM there. Then, when I got back inside, the lady at the tax desk still wouldn't let me in: despite this being Chile, she wouldn't accept my pesos; the tax had to be paid <em>in US dollars</em>.</p>
<p>So the customs policeman had to escort me outside once again, to change some of my pesos at a currency exchange. Then, and only then, the tax lady finally accepted my US$56 cash; and the immigration people stamped my passport, and let me into their country.</p>
<p>Thankfully &mdash; after the immense delay involved in paying the reciprocity tax &mdash; the shuttle bus that I'd booked ahead was still waiting for me. So I was able to get in the bus, zoom through the cold and dark freeways of Santiago, and arrive at <a href="/blog/hostal-de-sammy-santiago">Hostal de Sammy</a> by about 3am, where I crashed for what was left of the night.</p>
<p>Great, warm welcome to Chile, eh? And the icing-on-the-cake to what has been a <a href="/blog/secret-garden-robbery">really bad day</a>. Please g-d, wake me up when it's tomorrow, and please let the sun shine on me once more.</p>
