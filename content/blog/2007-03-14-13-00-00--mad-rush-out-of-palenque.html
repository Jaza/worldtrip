<p>Tara, Dan, Alan, and myself got a <em>colectivo</em> back from Palenque ruins. Since Alan and I were planning to go straight into town and find some transport to San Cristóbal, and since Tara and Dan also needed to go into town, we convinced the <em>colectivo</em> driver to stop in <em>El Panchán</em>, and to wait for us for 1 minute. However, I hadn't already packed up, so I needed to do so in a hurry!</p>

<p>Tara, Dan, Alan, and myself got a <em>colectivo</em> back from Palenque ruins. Since Alan and I were planning to go straight into town and find some transport to San Cristóbal, and since Tara and Dan also needed to go into town, we convinced the <em>colectivo</em> driver to stop in <em>El Panchán</em>, and to wait for us for 1 minute. However, I hadn't already packed up, so I needed to do so in a hurry!</p>
<p>I've never left anywhere in such a mad, lightning rush as I left <em>El Panchán</em>. I sprinted over to my hammock space, pulled down my hammock, stuffed my hammock (and everything else lying around) into my bag, put my bag on my back, and ran back to the waiting <em>colectivo</em> as quick as I could. When I got there, they were just about to give up waiting for me, and to drive off.</p>
<p>As I said to Alan, once we were in the <em>colectivo</em>: <em>"you'd think the Russians are coming!"</em></p>
