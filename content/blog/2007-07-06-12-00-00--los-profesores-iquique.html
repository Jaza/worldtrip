<p>Reasonable enough hostel, situated in the middle of things in Iquique. <a href="/blog/hostal-florida-san-pedro-de-atacama">As with San Pedro</a>, they have the annoying thing about paying for each night in advance; but at least here, they'll let you dump your bags in a storeroom after you've checked out. The place has a good vibe, even though I didn't particularly think the same of the city that it's in.</p>

<p>Reasonable enough hostel, situated in the middle of things in Iquique. <a href="/blog/hostal-florida-san-pedro-de-atacama">As with San Pedro</a>, they have the annoying thing about paying for each night in advance; but at least here, they'll let you dump your bags in a storeroom after you've checked out. The place has a good vibe, even though I didn't particularly think the same of the city that it's in.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> cramped little dorm, but at least it's warm.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> not too many other guests there; but the ones that they had were great fun.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> quite a friendly family-run affair; I really liked the staff. They all attempted to speak English, as well.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Iquique's not too big, and this place is pretty much right in the middle of it.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> very nice free breakfast of bread (but it's good bread, not Bolivian bread!), jam, and tea / coffee. Kitchen is not available for guest use (bit of a pain).</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 2 PCs with very fast Internet (really, it was quite impressive), available for USD$1 per day, unlimited use.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> apparently there was one hot shower; but the one I found was stone cold.</p>
