<p>Had an unexpected but most welcome surprise tonight: the staff at <a href="/blog/hostal-de-sammy-santiago">Hostal de Sammy</a> decided to throw a free BBQ for us! Great first night in Santiago: lovely home-cooked dinner of steak, salad, and chips; and an esky (or, as the kiwis working there called it, a "chilly-bin" &mdash; sorry Honour! :P) full of cold beers. The barbeque took place out on the back patio of Sammy's, where the guests and staff alike were able to sit and shmooze, in the pleasant (although slightly chilly) atmosphere of the Santiago evening.</p>
