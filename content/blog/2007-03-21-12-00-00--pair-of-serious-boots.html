<p>While I was in <em>Kaplan's</em> &mdash; the place where I got my <a href="/blog/big-ugly-good-raincoat">Army raincoat</a> &mdash; I also got myself a pair of serious boots. These fellas are <em>Carhartt</em>, a brand that specialises in workwear and military-use gear. I think they were pretty much the best pair of boots in the shop: thick-soled, hard-skinned, and waterproof; and yet reasonably flexible and comfortable as well. Orthotics fit in them just fine.</p>

<p><em>Big enough?</em></p>
<p>From now until the end of my trip, these are what I'm going to pretty much live in. My flimsy runners are already in the mail, on their way back home. It's time to get serious about this backpacking stuff.</p>
