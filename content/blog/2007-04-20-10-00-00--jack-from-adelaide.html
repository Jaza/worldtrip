<p>Jack and I met each other briefly at <a href="/blog/loki-hostel-cusco">Loki</a> last week, and then we both went <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">on a hike</a> (on different ones) to <a href="/blog/machu-picchu-tour">Machu Picchu</a>. Now, we're both back. By amazing coincidence, we're also both away for roughly the same 12-month period, we both have similar trip plans (or lack thereof), and we both get along really well. I've been hanging out with Jack this weekend, post-Salkantay; and I'm sure it's not the last time we'll see each other on this trip. Because Jack's a champion.</p>
