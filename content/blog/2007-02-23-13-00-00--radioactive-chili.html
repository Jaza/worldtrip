<p>Mauricio and Lachlan took Steve and myself out for lunch, to have some <em>moles</em>. The <em>moles</em> themselves weren't that spicy, but they came with something on the side that was, as Lachlan said, "bloody radioactive".

<p>I've been in training for the spices of Mexico for at least 10 years. Most of the chili and salsa I've had so far in Mexico has been pretty spicy, but still well within my tolerance threshold. However, nothing could have prepared me for this stuff. It's almost up there with <em>wusabi</em>, as far as "sheer lethality" goes.</p>
