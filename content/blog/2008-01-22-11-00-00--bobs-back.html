<p>He was with me omnipresently, during my sojourns in hippie-thronged Mexico and South America. He abandoned me in North America and in Europe, where nobody can fit so much as a pony-tail into their hectic modern lives, let alone a daily dose of stoned inner peace. But now that I'm in Thailand, I can most definitely say that my old friend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley">Bob Marley</a> is back, and that he's bigger than ever. Bob is, of course, the undisputed king of all Reggae, the mascot of all hippies, and the master of all chill-out music. His red-yellow-green, dreadlock-infused banner flies tall and proud, everywhere you may go in Thailand.</p>

<p>Whether you want to get stoned off your face to it, get wasted on Sang Som whisky to it, or simply "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Love_%28Bob_Marley_song%29">feel al-rite</a>" with it, none can deny that Bob is the answer. However, I swear: I've heard so much gawdaym, frikkin' Bob the past year, that if I ever do happen to see a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Soldier_(song)">buffalo soldier</a> one day, I'm takin' his motherf$#%in' buffalo a$$ <em>daown.</em> No, I am not feeling the love: I am feeling sick to death of hearing the same 4 or 5 Bob songs non-stop, for an entire year of backpacking! If there's one thing that will be good about getting home, it will be this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Woman%2C_No_Cry">No Marley, No Cry</a>.</p>
