<p>Do I really need to write this blog post? Considering <a href="/blog/packed-in-banos">what it was already like in the afternoon</a>, I think it's pretty obvious what was going down in Baños tonight, and what <a href="/blog/patrick-the-belgian">Patrick</a> and I got up to. Every place in "bar street" was open, and it was open all night long. Local girls. Copious drinking. Vigorous dancing. Pumping music. Get the picture? It was big &mdash; biggest night I've had in quite a while. Baños is the place to be, and this was the night to be here.</p>
