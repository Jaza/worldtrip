<p>I couldn't help but notice the trees on the side of the highway, during this morning's ride east from Sciacca. Call me a delusional Aussie drongo if you want, but I could have sworn they were gum trees. Or at least &mdash; if they weren't &mdash; they were some kind of Sicilian tree that sure as hell looks an awful lot <em>like</em> a gum tree. I suspect that the latter is the case. How could they have gum trees in Sicily? I know they've exported them to California, to the UK &mdash; even to the highlands of Peru &mdash; but surely not to Sicily. Anyway, some of them looked to be going brown for the autumn as well &mdash; and since Aussie gum trees are evergreen, that would conclusively indicate that they're something else. Anyway, what do you think &mdash; gum or gunk?</p>
