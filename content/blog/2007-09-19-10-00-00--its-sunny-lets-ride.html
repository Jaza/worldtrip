<p>For the first time since I arrived here in <abbr title="Buenos Aires">BA</abbr> &mdash; over a week ago &mdash; today it stopped raining, and the sun came out! Yay &mdash; good weather at last (it's been wet and freezing all week, until now). So with the sun finally shining, I decided it was time to immediately seize the day, by seizing one of the free bikes that they have at <a href="/blog/hostel-clan-ba">The Clan</a>, and to take myself on a bike tour around the city. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda">Master Yoda</a> would say: "good this weather finally is, so ride a bicycle you must".</p>
<p>The bikes that they have at The Clan (only two of them) are absolute pieces of crap: they're about the most rudimentary things I've ever seen. No gears, no handbrakes (only pedal-backwards brakes &mdash; haven't used those since about the age of 5), and not much else, really: but they have seats, handlebars, and pedals, and that's enough to get you on the road. And everyone else in this city seems to ride equally crap bikes, anyway: and you wouldn't be experiencing the place properly, if you didn't ride the same rustbuckets as all the locals!</p>
<p>I set off at about midday &mdash; managing to get the bike down the stairs and through the security doors at The Clan with some difficulty &mdash; and then I was off. Took a little while to get used to the extreme dodginess of the bike, and to get up to speed with the traffic system in BA (or lack thereof): but once I'd survived the first 5 minutes, the rest was child's play.</p>

<p><em>The Clan bike.</em></p>
<p>First stop on today's bike tour was San Telmo: the funky artists' neighbourhood that I <a href="/blog/san-telmo-market">visited on Sunday</a>, when it had its lively market going. Sadly, there was no market today: but all the trendy cafés and bars were still open, and there were still a few stalls set up in the main square. Riding in San Telmo can be a bit tricky, due to the bumpy old cobbled streets, and the fairly high amount of both vehicle and pedestrian traffic. But it's also a good, fun challenge.</p>

<p><em>Cobbled street in the centre of San Telmo.</em></p>
<p>From San Telmo I continued south, away from the downtown city centre, and towards the famous riverside area of La Boca (lit: "The Mouth" &mdash; referring to the mouth of the river, the <em>Río de la Plata</em>). Considering that I had no map, no compass, and no clear idea of where I had to go (I just kinda "tried to head south"), I think I did a pretty good job of finding my way there. La Boca is a poor, working-class area, with ramshackle houses (and even makeshift shelters) peppered amongst a sprawl of factories, warehouses, and docks. The area is dilapidated and a bit shifty; but nevertheless, it has a lot of character, and the people there seem to be reasonably friendly and non-hostile (during the day, anyway). La Boca also made for the best riding that I did today, as its many back streets are low on traffic (unlike most of BA), as well as flat and fairly well-maintained.</p>

<p><em>Big, ugly bridge overlooking the semi-slums of La Boca.</em></p>
<p>There is one little spot in the centre of La Boca, that's a starkly contrasting exception to the rest of the suburb. The street called "El Caminito" &mdash; and a few streets right next to it &mdash; is the well-known tourist haunt of the place, and the only part of La Boca that most tourists ever see. It's jam-packed with restaurants, cafés, souvenir shops, and street vendors selling artwork. A little bit like San Telmo &mdash; except that it's permeated by the working-class atmosphere of the neighbourhood surrounding it; and that it's next to the river, and has a nice view of, and a boardwalk by, the (hopelessly polluted) water.</p>

<p><em>Next to the water in La Boca.</em></p>
<p>From La Boca, I once again started cycling through the city, with an idea of where I wanted to go, but with nothing except a vague knowledge of my destination's whereabouts to get me there. Anyway, I guess I studied my <abbr title="Lonely Planet">LP</abbr> map pretty well, and I guess that my sense of direction isn't too bad after all: because I seemed to get where I wanted to go without any problems (not that I was in a hurry, of course).</p>
<p>I headed west from La Boca, continuing through the poorer neighbourhoods near the riverside, before cutting north and heading back towards the city centre. I went through Barrio Once &mdash; where I did my <a href="/blog/kosher-tour-of-ba">kosher tour of BA</a> &mdash; and from there, headed further north, through Barrio Norte and eventually Palermo: all the rich, upper-class, and heavily-trafficked parts of town. I stopped for lunch near a big park (I think it was sort of in Palermo), where I sat on the grass, and munched on some take-away gourmet <em>empanadas</em> while I basked in the ambiance. Nice area: lots of students lounging on the lawns; and lots of trendy-looking people walking their manicured pedigree dogs through the park.</p>

<p><em>Nice day to hang out in the park.</em></p>
<p>After that, all that I had left to cycle through and to see were the grand sights &mdash; such as the main plaza, and the fine arts museum &mdash; that take up much of the area north of the downtown city centre. And from there, it was straight down the gigantic Av. 9 de Julio, and back to the hostel.</p>

<p><em>Av. 9 de Julio, claimed to be the biggest road in the world, with as many as 10 lanes of traffic on each side (in some spots). Takes about 10 minutes and 4 sets of traffic lights to cross this road.</em></p>

<p>All up, a very enjoyable day's riding. The traffic was less-than-ideal for most of my route: but La Boca provided a nice relief from this for a bit; and it was so good to get out and to enjoy some nice weather again, that it didn't bother me too much anyway. Buenos Aires is a beautiful city, and one of the best ways to experience and to appreciate its grand beauty is on a bicycle.</p>
