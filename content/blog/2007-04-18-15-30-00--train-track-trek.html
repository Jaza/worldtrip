<p>This afternoon, train track trek is exactly what we did, in order to walk from <em>Hidro Electrico</em>, to tonight's haunt of Aguas Calientes. It literally was about 3 hours straight of walking either on or right beside the train line that goes (almost) to Machu Picchu. Long, tedious, and a bit risky when we had to jump off the track to make way for an oncoming train. But it got us there.</p>

<p>This was also the final leg of the <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">Salkantay hike</a> proper. Once we reached Aguas Calientes, we were at the foot of Machu Picchu, mountain, and as such, very close to the Inca Trail proper. We ceased to be part of "the group doing the challenging alternate trail", and we were suddenly thrown in with the mainstream masses "that come to see Machu Picchu".
