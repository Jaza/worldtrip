<p><a href="/blog/khao-san-road">Khao San Road</a> is absolutely chock-full of little stalls selling cheesy t-shirts. And since this is my last full day in Thailand, I couldn't resist picking up a few of them as souvenirs. As their brand name suggests, they are all pretty much "same same... but different". I especially like the "iPood" one, which is a not-at-all-subtle satire on that <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/">overpriced fashion accessory</a> which I've avoided owning for so many years. Also good is the one with the picture of cave man evolving into upright man, and then ultimately devolving into man hunched over a computer screen, with the inscription: "something somewhere went terrible wrong." Geek power! The <em>tuk-tuk</em> one is cute, too. It was tough to pick out a mere three, since they're all so funny and so wearable &mdash; but sadly, I can't take the entire contents of Khao San Road back home with me.</p>
