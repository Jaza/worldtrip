<p>So the class of <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a> week 2 ended up being myself, Debra, Justina, and Dorien. Chrystal and Ricky both moved to individual lessons on Tuesday, Chrystal because she was slow and holding up the group; and Ricky because he has hearing difficulties and needs the personal voice. We learnt a lot, but I'm still desperate to learn more. And once again, next week will be a new class, with me the only old-time veteran.</p>

<p>Although we did repeat a fair bit of last week's material this week, we ended up doing plenty of new stuff as well. For example, today we got through the grammar rules of two future tenses, and of the basic past tense, none of which I've learned at all before. That's the kind of stuff I really need to do more of. And fingers crossed, I will.
</p>
<p>So another week's gone by at Amigos, and my Spanish has continued to improve, and once again it's been a fun week as well. I'm through the half-way mark of my four week stint now: let's see what new knowledge the second half brings.</p>
