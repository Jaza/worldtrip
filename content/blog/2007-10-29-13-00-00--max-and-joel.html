<p>These two lads are flat-sharing here in London's Mile End area, and they're being kind and hospitable enough to host my mate <a href="/blog/jack-from-adelaide">Jack</a>, during his week or so in the city. Max is a London local, and Joel's originally an Irish boy. Max met Jack a few years ago, when he was backpacking round the world, and when he crashed at Jack's place in Adelaide. Now he's returning the favour. Great blokes.</p>
