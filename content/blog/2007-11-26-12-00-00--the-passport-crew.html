<p>When I <a href="/blog/aussie-embassy-day">visited the Australian Embassy</a> today, I was amazed to see that no less than <strong>four</strong> other Aussies had also had their passports stolen in Italy during the weekend &mdash; two others also on the train, one on a ferry, and another on the street. Ridiculous: theft is absolutely rife and out-of-control in this country! Plus, most of them were exercising at least as much care with their valuables as I do, if not more. There was a middle-aged couple from Wollongong, as well as two women from Melbourne, all of whom had been robbed just like me. We kept each other company in the embassy today, while we waited for our new emergency passports to be issued.</p>
