<p>I've had enough of Mexico City by now. There's more to see here, of course: mainly museums, art galleries, and markets. But at the end of the day, it's just a (really) big city. Everyone here seems to just be treating Mexico City as a thoroughfare, or as a waypoint; but not as a destination. So I hopped on a bus and went to Xalapa.</p>

<p>I've had enough of Mexico City by now. There's more to see here, of course: mainly museums, art galleries, and markets. But at the end of the day, it's just a (really) big city.

</p>
<p>My first inter-city bus in Mexico was quite nice. It was a first-class bus, and it was with <a href="http://www.ado.com.mx/">ADO</a>, one of the best bus companies in the country. This meant air-conditioning, and movies.
</p>
<p><strong>Trip time:</strong> 5.5 hours.
</p>
<p><strong>Movies that I watched:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>King's Ransom (1 out of 5).</li>
<li>Flight Plan (1 out of 5).></li>
</ol>
<p>Watching movies dubbed in Spanish can be quite fun and challenging, but after a while it gets annoying. Also, I don't think that either of the movies on this trip would have been much good, even in English.</p>
