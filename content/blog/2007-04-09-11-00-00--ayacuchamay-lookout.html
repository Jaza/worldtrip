<p>Ayacuchamay is a plaza and lookout area, on a hill that overlooks the whole town and the surrounding mountains. This morning, I met up with my mate <a href="/blog/abimael-riveros">Abimael</a>, and the two of us &mdash; as well as <a href="/blog/cath-and-gaz">Cath and Gaz</a> &mdash; went up to the lookout. From the top of the hilltop tower, you get an excellent view of everything that is Ayacucho. Nice clear day too, so we could see the mountains, as they stretched on to the horizon.</p>
