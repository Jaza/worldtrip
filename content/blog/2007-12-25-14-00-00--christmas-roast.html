<p>Christmas lunch was cancelled today, on account of having <a href="/blog/skiing-with-the-swedes">better things to do</a>; but we made up for it this evening, with a fine dinner of roast chicken. <a href="/blog/craig-sarah-and-kade">Craig, Sarah, Kade</a> and myself feasted on chicken breast (originally frozen &mdash; they were out of fresh chook), crispy potatoes, corn cobs and various vegies &mdash; with a side of seasonal cranberry sauce. Sadly, the roast (as roasts do) took much longer than expected to cook, so we were bloody starving by the time it was ready. Shots of Jäger and several <a href="/blog/circle-of-death">card games</a> comprised dessert.</p>
