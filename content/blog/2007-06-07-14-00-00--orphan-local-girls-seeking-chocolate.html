<p>After only one day in Bolivia, I've already met my first two (of many) stark raving mad locals. These two cute little girls from Isla Del Sol demanded chocolate from us numerous times. When we refused, they explained how their parents are dead &mdash; <em>"viven en el cielo"</em> (lit: "they live in the sky") &mdash; and when we gave them some, they burst into hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>I don't know what the government feeds the kids round here, but whatever it is, it's a real worry. And I don't buy the bull$#?% <em>"viven en el cielo"</em> story for one minute, either. What do they think, every <em>gringo</em> on Earth's completely braindead, or something?</p>
