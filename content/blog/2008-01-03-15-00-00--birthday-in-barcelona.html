<p>It's downright impossible to believe, but as of today, my life as a 21-year-old has officially come to a close. Today was the big day, Jan Third: happy 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday to me! I didn't do all that much to celebrate: just the usual hanging out, grabbing dinner, and shmoozing down in the <a href="/blog/kabul-hostel-barcelona">Kabul</a> lounge and bar. I didn't even partake in any birthday drinking: seeing as I was still recovering from <a href="/blog/one-kebab-too-many">an unfortunate lunch</a>, I elected to just sip on water all evening instead. Birthdays are always good: but I must say that as birthdays go, 22 really is something of an anticlimax after the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaza/sets/72157594521812447/">feistiness of 21</a>.</p>

<p>Barcelona is a daym cool place to celebrate your birthday. And Kabul is a great hostel for having fun and partying. And in the mere day that I've been here, I already seem to have picked up quite a few buddies in the vicinity. But despite all that, the fact remains that this is my first-ever birthday away from home, and that being all alone on the other side of the world for your birthday just isn't the same. I'd be a blatant liar if I didn't admit that something was lacking today &mdash; and that something was people. As a general rule, I haven't suffered a great deal of homesickness on this trip: but today, I really did feel the absence of my friends and my family around me; and I did wonder what the hell I was doing here, and why I wasn't back home where everyone would be sharing in the celebrations with me. I did of course call my parents &mdash; but they're only two of the many people I'd normally see at this time; and besides, there's only so much you can communicate over a telephone line. Having your birthday abroad is an interesting experience, but it's not for the faint-hearted.</p>
