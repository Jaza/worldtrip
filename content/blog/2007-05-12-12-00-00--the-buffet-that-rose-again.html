<p>After our <a href="/blog/pisac-ruins-morning">tour of the Pisac ruins</a> this morning, <a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a> and I went for a very expensive, very classy, and very big buffet lunch at a hotel / restaurant in Urubamba (next town along in the <em>Valle Sagrado</em>). It was quite an excellent meal &mdash; or so I thought at the time. Endless plates of pasta, chicken, bean stew, alpaca (first time for me!), and mouth-watering cake. It was all positively delicious. It all cost a whopping USD$15 per head (about s/50 &mdash; you can get a 3-course meal in Cusco for s/2). And about 5 hours later, it all rose right back up, and gave me a violent bout of food poisoning. Beware the top-dollar, top-brass buffets: because clearly they ain't always top-quality.</p>
