<p><em>Farang</em> is Thai for "foreigner". And here in Thailand, all foreigners &mdash; no matter how vile or undeserving their behaviour may be &mdash; all of us are <em>very</em> welcome indeed. Having just arrived here this evening, I once again find myself a rich, Western foreigner travelling in the developing world. <a href="/blog/europe-the-big-wrapup">After Europe</a>, that will take some getting used to. Whereas I was previously the "s$#% of kings", I'm suddenly now the "king of s$#%" again: and with this new situation comes the advantages of constant pampering, of being surrounded by all things cheap, and of a heady wonderland where anything and everything is possible, based on nothing more than a fat wallet and an on-the-spot whim. <em>Gringo... farang...</em> same diff, new lingo. It's unfair, it's exploitative, and it's artificial. But hey, it's nice to be special again &mdash; nice to be back "in the club".</p>
