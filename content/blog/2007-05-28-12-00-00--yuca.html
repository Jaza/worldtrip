<p>Also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava">Cassava</a>, <em>yuca</em> is a starchy, soft white vegetable that's eaten in many parts of the world, but more than anywhere else in its birthplace of tropical South America. It tastes like a bland potato, it's usually served boiled, and it's surprisingly filling. I ate quite a lot of <em>yuca</em> during my jungle trip in Pilcopata, where it's a staple food for every meal of the day.</p>
