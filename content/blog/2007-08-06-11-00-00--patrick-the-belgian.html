<p>Another solo traveller, like myself, who's off to see the world for 12 months. Patrick's a master's graduate of Economics and Politics, he's a Belgian, he's an ace soccer player, and he's quite the ladies' man. First met him in M치ncora last week, and I'm planning to spend the rest of the week here in Ba침os with him, going on recreational adventures by day, and on bar-bound adventures by night.</p>
