<p>I haven't bought any novels for a long time: so far on my trip, I've been subsisting on whatever paperbacks I can scrounge up at hostel book exchanges. This is all well and good, but the quality at those exchanges is generally somewhat lacking. I walked past a second-hand fair in Bristol this afternoon, and I couldn't resist buying a few quality novels. Grabbed myself "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Mango-Norman-Kelley/dp/1888451106">The Big Mango</a>", by Norman Kelley; and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blast-Past-Ben-Elton/dp/0385334524">Blast from the Past</a>", by Ben Elton. Seeing as I won't be in England again for a while, I managed to justify this little luxury to myself.</p>
