<p>I ordered this dish (en Español: <em>"ñoqui de cuatro estaciones"</em>) at a little café this evening, where I went for dinner with <a href="/blog/oly-the-brit">Oly</a>, <a href="/blog/michal-and-or">Michal and Or</a>. Not only were the gnocchi balls themselves sensational: the sauce was also the richest and the tastiest cheese sauce I've ever eaten. They obviously used some very fine, European "smelly cheeses" in the sauce &mdash; and the result was out of this world. Mmm, gnocchi: <em>"contigo, la vita é bella"</em>.</p>
