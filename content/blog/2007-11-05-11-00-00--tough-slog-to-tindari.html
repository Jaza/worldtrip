<p>From my night's abode at <a href="/blog/camping-bazia">Camping Bazia</a>, this morning I cycled on, and tackled the winding road that leads up to Capo Tindari, and to the village and attractions at the top. It was quite a tough uphill ride &mdash; like <a href="/blog/capo-di-milazzo">Capo di Milazzo</a> to its east, Capo Tindari is tall and steep &mdash; and a sprinkling of damp, drizzly rain along the way didn't help, either. However, once I reached the top, the weather improved, and the sights proved to be worth the effort. Not that I had a choice, anyway: not only is Tindari a major attraction in this part of Sicily; there's also no easy way around it. As well as some Greek ruins (which I skipped), Tindari is also home to a very impressive church, which sits right atop the cape (above the village), and which overlooks the cliffs and the sea beyond.</p>

<p><em>Impressive church atop the cape.</em></p>
<p>Apparently, this church is actually not that special &mdash; it's quite new, most of it was built about 50 years ago &mdash; and its only real significance is that it honours the apparition of a saint, that various people believe they saw here at the time. Anyhow, I went inside and had a look: it's quite nice on the inside as well; but there were several pilgrims praying in the hall, so I felt it prudent to abstain from taking pictures. The greek ruins of Tyndaris &mdash; also at the top of the cape &mdash; are not so obviously visible, and are apparently not that breathtaking anyway; so I didn't bother hunting them out.</p>
<p>Since I was camping rough last night, and I didn't have access to any bathroom or kitchen facilities, this morning I found myself running somewhat short of water. I'm carrying a large supply with me: but I used up a fair bit in cooking and washing-up last night; plus I've also been drinking no small amount of the stuff. Fortunately, there was a large public drinking fountain in Tindari village, so I was able to fill up there as much as I wanted. If everywhere in Sicily has free, clean, public drinking water available, that's going to make my life a whole lot easier &mdash; I can only hope that this will be the case.</p>
