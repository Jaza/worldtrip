<p>I've been in Bangkok for one (jetlagged and sleepless) night; and if there's one thing I've already noticed to death, it's this: the air pollution here is <em>horrendous.</em> This is one seriously polluted city: you can see it, smell it and even taste it 24/7. <a href="/blog/the-air-in-mexico-city">Mexico City</a> is peanuts compared to this place. Bangkok's sky is permanently marred by a greyish haze: this becomes particularly foul and unmissable around dusk, when the sky's colour turns a disturbingly nuclear-ish shade of purple against the hot Thai sunset. The constant heat in the city doesn't exactly help, either &mdash; what with the smog, the dryness and the sweltering temperatures, water and air-con is the only way to live around here.</p>
