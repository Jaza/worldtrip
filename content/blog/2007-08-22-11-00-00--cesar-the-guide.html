<p>César doesn't say much when he's up on the mountain &mdash; he's too busy stopping you from falling off the edge &mdash; but when he's back in civilisation, he's a real friendly guy. Like all climbing guides, he's incredibly fit, and ready for pretty much any emergency: as guides go, he's up there in the elite. César took <a href="/blog/tony-the-diver">Tony</a> and myself <a href="/blog/cotopaxi-climb-a-noble-defeat">up Cotopaxi</a> this week, and we all agree that weather permitting, he would have gotten us to the top as well.</p>
