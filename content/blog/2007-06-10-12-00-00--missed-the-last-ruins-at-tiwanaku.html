<p>After we finished our <a href="/blog/tiwanaku-ruins">guided tour of the Tiwanaku ruins</a> this afternoon, our guide told us that there was one more little section left for us to see, if we wanted to have a look at it.

However, even at 4:40pm, we were too late &mdash; already shut. Closing earlier than advertised is a popular pastime, here in Bolivia.</p>

<p>After we finished our <a href="/blog/tiwanaku-ruins">guided tour of the Tiwanaku ruins</a> this afternoon, our guide told us that there was one more little section left for us to see, if we wanted to have a look at it. But we had to hurry, because it was 4:30pm, and all the ruins closed at 5pm. So <a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a> and myself (Pascale elected instead to sit and smoke) went to check them out. However, even at 4:40pm, we were too late &mdash; already shut. Closing earlier than advertised is a popular pastime, here in Bolivia.</p>
<p>The early closing of the ruins wasn't so weird; but what was really weird, was that when a group of three local boys walked past us, and saw us standing outside the closed ruins, they suddenly burst into hysterical laughter. More <a href="/blog/orphan-local-girls-seeking-chocolate">stark raving mad locals</a> in this country. I have no idea what they found so funny: but when we asked them <em>"are the ruins shut already?"</em>, they simply could not help themselves. They abso-bloody-lutely lost it. Rolling round in the dirt laughing, pointing and shouting at us. Apparently, there's something about us <em>gringos</em> &mdash; it seems that we just have so little idea about how things work (or don't work) in Bolivia, that they find it hilarious.</p>
