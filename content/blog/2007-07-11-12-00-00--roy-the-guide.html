<p>Roy was our guide on our <a href="/blog/into-the-canon-del-colca">three-day hike in the Cañon del Colca</a>, and he's one of the funniest and craziest guides I've had so far on my trip. Every time we asked him how much hiking we have left for the day, he'd say something like: <em>"nueve horas mas"</em> ("nine hours more"). Sometimes it was hard to tell whether he was joking, or being serious. But we all loved his humour, and he did a great job of leading us through the canyon, and of then helping us get safely back into Arequipa at the end of the trip.</p>
