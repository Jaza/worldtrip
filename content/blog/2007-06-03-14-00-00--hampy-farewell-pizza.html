<p>To say farewell and thank-you to me, for all my work on the <a href="/blog/hampy-site-progressing-but-needs-more-work">Hampy web site</a>, <a href="/blog/jorge-from-hampy">Jorge</a> ordered in an absolutely massive pizza tonight; and myself, Jorge, <a href="/blog/ashley-from-hampy">Ashley</a>, and <a href="/blog/stephan-from-hampy">Stephan</a> managed to team up and devour it at the <a href="http://hampy.org/">Hampy</a> office. Half chicken, half pepperoni. And a superb bottle of Argentinean Mendoza red wine to go with it. Couldn't ask for a better way to finish up my time with Hampy, and with Cusco.</p>
