<p>Here's an important one for describing those ever-present, ever-inquisitive, ever-adorable Peruvian children: <em>travieso</em> ("cheeky"). The word <em>travieso</em> literally means "naughty". Other possibilities for describing those devilish little antics include <em>fresco</em> (also "cheeky" &mdash; literally "fresh"), and <em>descarado</em> (once again "cheeky" &mdash; literally "shameless"). The kids around here are generally fairly well-behaved &mdash; but they're also almost always in big groups, so this gives them the confidence to do mischievous things that they might not otherwise dare to do. So watch out!</p>
