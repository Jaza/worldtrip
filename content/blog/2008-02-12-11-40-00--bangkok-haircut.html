<p>Getting a haircut in Bangkok may be cheap, but you really do get what you pay for. I figured I should get some hair chopped off before I head home &mdash; it's a bargain here, plus I never get round to it when I'm in Sydney. I asked the lady: "number one on the sides, and nice and short on top &mdash; but don't shave the top." And what does she do? She says: "OK, no ploblem" &mdash; and then proceeds to brandish her shaver, and... <em>vrooomp!</em> There goes my hair. All but completely shaved off. "You say number one on side and short on top", she explained (this was just before I strangled her to death with a hair-dryer cord, you understand). "So I do number two on top." <strong>Arrgghhh!</strong> Hence, when you see me back in Sydney and I look like a gawdaym US Marine, you'll appreciate why and how this came to be. Next time, I think I'll get my hair cut by someone who speaks just a <em>little</em> more English.</p>
