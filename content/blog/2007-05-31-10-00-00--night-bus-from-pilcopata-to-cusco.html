<p>If you want to face death on the side of a forested cliff in the middle of the night (and possible live to tell the tale), then catch the night bus from Pilcopata to Cusco. It was the <a href="/blog/long-way-to-pilcopata">same incredibly bad road</a> that we took to get to Pilcopata on Monday; but it was wet, it was uphill, and it was pitch-black. Massive unsealed pot-holes, in the dark. Hairpin cliff-side bends, in the dark. Passing oncoming vehicles on a road thinner than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue">Kylie</a>'s waist, in the dark. Next time, I think I'll walk back.</p>

<p>We left Pilcopata on the local public bus at about 8:30pm last night, and we arrived back in Cusco at about 6:30am this morning. It takes longer on the way back &mdash; especially at night. I was fortunate enough to be able to (miraculously) sleep through most of the trip; but on the occasions that I did wake up, I was vaguely aware of the ridiculous danger that the bus was constantly putting itself in. For <a href="/blog/ashley-from-hampy">Ashley, <a href="/blog/wil-from-amigos">Wil</a>, and <a href="/blog/stephan-from-hampy">Stephan</a>, however, there was almost no sleep to be had (for various reasons &mdash; e.g. mortal fear, back pain), and it was a long and horrid trip back. Anyway, thank G-d we all made it back in one piece.</p>
