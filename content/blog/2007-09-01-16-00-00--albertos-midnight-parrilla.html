<p>Tonight was the perfect introduction to this country for me. Only in Argentina can you go to a truly authentic <em>parrilla</em> (special Argentinean steak house) and get the best steak on the planet (along with the best wine on the planet); and only in Argentina can you turn up at midnight, and find the restaurant still jam-packed!  The place in question was <a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/sancarlosdebariloche/D48053.html">Alberto's</a>, the best and most famous (and yet quite cheap) <em>parrilla</em> in Bariloche. Turned up at about 11:50pm, and only just managed to get a table. And the <em>bife de lomo</em> (tenderloin steak &mdash; three of them in a single order) was so soft and so juicy, I'd say it's pretty much unbeatable.</p>

<p>Tonight was the perfect introduction to this country for me. Only in Argentina can you go to a truly authentic <em>parrilla</em> (special Argentinean steak house) and get the best steak on the planet (along with the best wine on the planet); and only in Argentina can you turn up at midnight, and find the restaurant still jam-packed!  The place in question was <a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/sancarlosdebariloche/D48053.html">Alberto's</a>, the best and most famous (and yet quite cheap) <em>parrilla</em> in Bariloche. Turned up at about 11:50pm, and only just managed to get a table. And the <em>bife de lomo</em> (tenderloin steak &mdash; three of them in a single order) was so soft and so juicy, I'd say it's pretty much unbeatable.</p>
<p>After chilling in the living room of <a href="/blog/patanuk-hostel-bariloche">Patanuk</a> for a few hours this evening, three of us &mdash; <a href="/blog/finlandia">Finlandia</a>, Elysa (New York girl), and myself &mdash; made the trip over to <em>El Boliche de Alberto</em>. I really couldn't have asked for anything more: I've been holding out for a good Argentinean steak for several months now (been receiving juicy reports from every traveller I've met, up in <abbr title="Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia">PEB</abbr>); and to go to the best one in town, during my first night in the country, was a dream come true!</p>
<p>As well as the <em>bife de lomo</em>, we also got a bit of <em>entrañas</em>, which is appparently a cut of beef from the lining between the cow's stomach and its intestines. Anyway, although this does sound a bit dicey and gross, the meat is a beautiful and tender piece of steak &mdash; definitely nothing gross about it. Both the <em>lomo</em> and the <em>entrañas</em> were sensational.</p>
<p>However, I promised myself that when I came to Argentina, I'd try and find some steak that's better than what you can get at my favourite steak house in the world, which is <a href="http://www.hurricanesgrill.com.au/">Hurricane</a>, on Bondi Beach in Sydney. And I'm sorry to say that although Alberto's does do some fine grilling, Hurricane retains the title of <em>numero uno</em> in my books. So c'mon, Argentina: if you want to prove that you really do have the best steaks on the planet, you'll have to live up to the competition from Down Under. Anyway, I have plenty of time to find more steak houses while I'm here &mdash; and believe me, I intend to eat at as many of the daym places as I can, until I'm no longer physically capable of consuming more steak.</p>
<p>And the wine: ohhhhh my G-d, tonight's bottle was absolutely heavenly! Argentina hasn't yet gotten my No. 1 vote on the steak front; but there's no doubt that it does, unequivocally, offer <strong>THE VERY BEST</strong> red wine in the world. The bottle was, of course, a Malbec (Argentina's speciality &mdash; like Cabernet Sauvignon, but better); and it was, of course, from Mendoza (the area that produces 70% of the nation's wine). And incredibly cheap, too: our bottle was about $7, and they have them cheaper (and this is in a restaurant!).</p>
<p>I'm so goddamn sick of beer: I'm very much looking forward to living on wine for breakfast, lunch and dinner, during my entire time here in Argentina; and beer can go %#$&amp; itself. Mendoza and Malbec: 100% the perfect combination. And when drunk with an <em>en punto</em> ("medium-rare") <em>parrilla</em> over dinner, it becomes the 110% perfect combo.</p>
<p>And hey, I heard that in Argentina they like to do things late &mdash; but to see first-hand that "if you turn up at a restaurant at midnight, you get served no problem" in this country &mdash; that is very cool indeed. I guess it makes sense: around here, midnight is a bit early (that's right: <strong>early</strong>) to hit the clubs; so you may as well grab half a cow for dinner, before you go dancing.</p>
