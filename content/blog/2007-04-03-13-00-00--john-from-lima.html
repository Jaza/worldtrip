<p>There are plenty of fun people staying here at the <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a>, but the only really crazy person here is one of the staff: John. Speaking a little of every language on Earth (including Hebrew), always quick with a wild greeting or a joke, and eager to party and to get drunk with the guests, we've all come to think of John as "one of us", not as a staff member.</p>
