<p>It wasn't short. It wasn't cheap. And it <em>was</em> a big chunk eaten out of my travelling and exploration time in South America. But it was definitely worth it. In my four weeks at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>, and <a href="/blog/staying-with-the-polar-covarrubias-family">with the Polar Covarrubias family</a>, I learned a lot of Spanish, I made some great friends, and I got a lot of love (and plenty of food, too!). Plus, during the whole thing I was in Cusco, where I could party at night, explore the area on weekends, get by pretty cheap, and stay fairly safe. All up, a great experience, and one that will surely benefit me in the rest of my travels.</p>

<h2>Amigos</h2>
<p>I really couldn't be happier with my choice of Spanish school. The quality of teaching is top-notch. The activities are great fun. And the place is small, cosy, warm, and as friendly as you could ask for. After four weeks in a place like Amigos, you can't help but feel like more than a student there &mdash; you feel like a part of the institution. And, of course, the English program for the local youth makes Amigos a unique and charitable non-profit school.</p>
<h2>Family stay</h2>
<p>Getting a good family to stay with is a bit of a lucky dip; and I certainly got lucky here in Cusco. Great meals, lots of love and care, and a tonne of Spanish speaking practice. The fact that I was treated like a prince (couldn't help with anything, in the kitchen or anywhere else), and that I was being mothered, was starting to get to be a bit much by the end &mdash; but it was nice nonetheless. And staying with a local family is really the only way to get to know the local way of life properly: because here in Peru, family is life.</p>
