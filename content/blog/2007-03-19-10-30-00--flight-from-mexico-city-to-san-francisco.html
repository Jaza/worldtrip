<p>This flight was even longer than my flight a month earlier, from Los Angeles to Mexico City: today's flight took me a good 4.5 hours. Because I had to get up at 3:30am to make it this morning, I was absolutely dog tired; unfortunately, though, it was too sunny for me to get any shut-eye on the plane. This United flight was quite pleasant: I had some friendly fellow passengers, and there was even something good on the TV.</p>

<p>This flight was even longer than my flight a month earlier, from Los Angeles to Mexico City: today's flight took me a good 4.5 hours. Because I had to get up at 3:30am to make it this morning, I was absolutely dog tired; unfortunately, though, it was too sunny for me to get any shut-eye on the plane. This United flight was quite pleasant: I had some friendly fellow passengers, and there was even something good on the TV.</p>
<p>My two fellow passengers had just come down to Mexico City for the weekend, from San Francisco. One of them was a native SFian, and the other guy was originally from Venezuela. The Venezuelan (in particular) was a real nice guy, and he had plenty of advice to give me about South America.</p>
<p>I didn't bother watching the movie on this flight &mdash; I was trying (unsuccessfully) to sleep at that point. However, towards the end, they showed a really interesting documentary all about the history and behind-the-scenes of <em>Seinfeld</em>, which I started tuning in to, as soon as I noticed that it was on. I've been a big fan of <em>Seinfeld</em>, ever since Liam gave me his complete collection to watch (I finished watching it just before I left). didn't realise that the show had such a rocky start! No wonder they made fun of NBC and network politics in the series itself: that stuff all really happened.</p>
