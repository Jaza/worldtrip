<p>These two girls &mdash; Ashley from Nevada, USA; and Megan from Ottawa, Canada &mdash; have both been staying here at <a href="/blog/aquario-ilha-grande">Aquario</a> with me all week. They're both blonde, beautiful, brash, talkative, and fresh from Oktoberfest, which they just celebrated in its true home &mdash; Southern Germany. Now that they're down here in Brazil, they're still living that Oktober spirit, by continuing to drink copious quantities of whatever beer they can get their hands on, and by continuing to rant and sing gregariously whenever the moment takes their fancy. Awesome free spirits &mdash; the girls, that is, not their beverages :P.</p>
