<p>The literal translation of <em>amaneciendo</em> is "dawning" (of the day). However, <em>en Espa침ol</em> this word is a vivid and romantic thing to say. It alludes to the beauty of the gradual change in colour of the sky at dawn, from pitch black to dark greyish-blue, to a paler shade of misty blue, and finally to the beautiful golden orangey-blue that can be seen just before sunrise. Along with the sky, <em>"est치 amaneciendo"</em> (lit: <em>"it's dawning"</em>) brings with it the chirping of the birds, the rustling of the leaves, and the serenity of the sea. It's a good thing to say to your girlfriend, next time you're on an ocean cruise watching the day be born.</p>
