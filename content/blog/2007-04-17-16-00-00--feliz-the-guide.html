<p>On the <a href="/blog/salkantay-hike-the-wrapup">Salkantay hike</a>, Feliz is our own personal guide. He's done the hike over 20 times, and he knows it inside out; and he can finish it in &frac14; the time that we can. We gave him a hard time on the trip, for his only-just-adequate English skills, and for his sometimes being slack in keeping us together and not lost. But at the end of the day, he's a great guy, and we couldn't have done it without him.</p>
