<p>Spent the entire morning in the water at <em>Playa</em>. It was so absolutely stunning and relaxing, I couldn't pull myself out. I lazed around in the shallows for a while; then I swam to the other end of the beach and back again, exploring everything in between. I hope I don't die anytime soon, because when (and if!) I go to heaven, I doubt it could be better than this.</p>

<p>The beach is longer and more varied than I thought. People only really swim in a few little pockets of the beach. In between, there are boats (with their dirt, and their petrol smell), and there's a pier. But it's possible to swim around most of these, if you really want to (and I did!). There are also people doing all sorts of watersports &mdash; such as parasailing, jetskiing, and scuba diving &mdash; in numerous spots along the beach.</p>
