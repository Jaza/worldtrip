<p>I learned a lot of Spanish during my time at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>, but I still have a huge thirst to learn more. And what better way to continue my learning, than to start reading some Spanish books? So, today I bought my five <em>primeros libros en Español</em> (lit: "first books in Spanish"). At s/10 for the five of them, total bargain. And they should certainly keep me busy for at least the next few weeks, whenever I have spare time to kill on my trip.</p>

<p>These books are all small, easy little paperbacks &mdash; most of them written mainly for children &mdash; so they should be perfect primers for me as well. The first book, <em>El Principito</em>, was recommended to me by <a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a> as a good starter book in Spanish (I think almost everyone learning Spanish tries to read it). It's a children's book, originally written in French, and nice and easy as far as the grammar goes.
</p>
<p>The next two &mdash; <em>Ollantay</em>, and <em>Cuentos Peruanos</em> &mdash; are Peruvian books: still written for children; but a bit more advanced, and a bit more rich in local culture. <em>Ollantay</em> is a historical story, from the time of the <em>conquistadores</em>; and <em>Cuentos Peruanos</em> is a collection of Quechua and other folk tales.  The fourth book, <em>Don Quijote de la Mancha</em>, is also a historical story; but from Spain.
</p>
<p>I got the fifth one &mdash; the cookbook <em>Comida Peruana</em> &mdash; just for a bit of fun; and also as something to take home, for when I want to whip up some Peruvian cuisine in years to come. All up, great little purchases, and ones that will keep me busy and learning for quite a while on my trip.</p>
