<p>And it's called Sairee Beach, Ko Tao. I'm blurting out the secret &mdash; so consider yourself privileged. This place is heaven. For our first day on Ko Tao, <a href="/blog/alex-and-caroline">Alex, Caroline</a> and myself spent most of the day semi-conscious on Sairee Beach, letting the water lap at our feet and the sun pour down on our backs.

It was a chilled evening: just a few drinks at one of Sairee's super-mellow beach bars, sprawled out on the island's ubiquitous cushion-and-mat "seating", before exhaustion overcame us and we crashed into bed. If the rest of my time on Ko Tao is going to be like this, then things are looking real good indeed.</p>
