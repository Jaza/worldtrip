<p>After six years of skiing, and after <a href="/blog/catedral-snowboarding-final-day">one week of snowboarding</a>, I can now say with confidence that I've experienced both of these alpine sports, and that I'm able to talk about them a bit and to compare them. So here's a few reflective points in favour of snowboarding, and a few more in favour of skiing. I'm not making any decisive call here on which one I think is the better &mdash; just spelling out my views on the advantages and the disadvantages of each. The verdict, I leave in your hands.</p>
<p>Some reasons why snowboarding is better than skiing:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can go from beginner to semi-advanced within your first week</li>
<li>You can go down <em>any run</em>, no matter how difficult, in "chicken mode" (i.e. by "boardploughing")</li>
<li>Snowboard boots are about 6 x 10<sup>13</sup> times more comfortable than ski boots</li>
<li>Stopping and sitting down on the snow (to relax, to enjoy the view, to massage your bruised a$$, etc) is easier and more natural on a board</li>
<li>Falling down isn't such a big deal: your board never comes off your feet, like skis do; and getting up is a bit easier on a board (once you get used to it)</li>
<li>It just <em>feels way cooler</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And some reasons why skiing is better than snowboarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the first week, falling down is very rare</li>
<li>You can go down "catwalks" (narrow, slightly steep downhill paths) quite easily, by snowploughing now and then, and by using your poles to push yourself along the flat bits</li>
<li>There's always more to learn with skiing: every time you ski, you can still improve by leaps and bounds, and you can still learn more of the technical aspects</li>
<li>Going up (and getting off!) chairlifts and pommers is much easier on skis</li>
<li>Most skiers aspire to going down harder runs, not to doing crazy jumps and looking like hot stuff</li>
<li>Good skiers look sleek and graceful &mdash; these words simply don't fit as descriptions of anyone who snowboards</li>
<li>Skiers don't wreck the slopes by scraping away masses of snow with each stop</li>
<li>When you're skiing, you're always more-or-less looking down the hill and in front of you; when snowboarding, half the time you're facing backwards, and you have to twist your head around to see in front of you</li>
<li>Most skiers aren't dickheads (and most snowboarders are)</li>
<li>Learning to ski doesn't involve so much <strong>pain</strong>, whereas learning to board leaves you black and blue</li>
</ul>
