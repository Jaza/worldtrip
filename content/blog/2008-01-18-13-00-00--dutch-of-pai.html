<p>These two Dutch boys were part of the super-friendly crew that kept me company, during this morning's <a href="/blog/off-to-pai">road trip to Pai</a>. They're two guys who are friends from back home, and who are taking a little summer break in-between their studies. For most of my time here in Pai, I kept bumping into them again and again: and each time that I saw them, both myself and them were ever more wasted.</p>
