<p>Back in Argentina, I commented on the <a href="/blog/catedrals-funky-lift-tickets">hi-tech lift ticket system</a> that they now use at <a href="http://www.catedralaltapatagonia.com/">Cerro Catedral</a>. At the time, I was quite impressed. However, I now have to say that the Catedral tickets aren't so funky after all: <a href="http://en.kitzbuehel.com/">Kitzbühel</a>'s redefine the notion of funk altogether. Instead of merely sporting scannable barcodes, the tickets here at Kitzbühel are true <abbr title="Radio Frequency ID">RFID</abbr> devices. No need to pull them out of your pocket, wave them under an infra-red reader, and wait for the beep. No, sirree! These babies require no effort whatsoever: you just leave them in your pocket, and walk right through the turnstiles &mdash; they register as soon as you reach the barrier, at which point you hear a little beep, and in you go. As long as you make sure to keep your ticket in your <em>left</em> pocket (as all the sensors seem to be on the left side of the turnstiles), it's as easy as pie.</p>
