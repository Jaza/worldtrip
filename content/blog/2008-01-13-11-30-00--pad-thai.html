<p><a href="http://www.thaitable.com/Thai/recipes/Pad_Thai.htm">Pad Thai</a> is so famous, it's virtually synonymous with Thai cuisine. For many people, it's the only Thai dish they know; and for more still, it's the one that they love above all others. And it's little wonder, seeing that this quick and simple rice-noodle stir-fry dish &mdash; generally cooked with egg, and sometimes also with chicken, pork or shrimp &mdash; is one of the tastiest, the cheapest and the most widely-available in all of Thailand. I love Pad Thai, and as far as I'm concerned, <a href="/blog/cooking-in-chiang-mai">today's cooking class</a> wouldn't have been complete without it.</p>
