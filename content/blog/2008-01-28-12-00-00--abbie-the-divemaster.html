<p>Abbie's a cheerful English girl, who's been travelling around the world for several months, and who's recently completed a long volunteering stint down in southern Africa. Abbie's currently undertaking her DMT (Divemaster Training) course with <a href="/blog/bans-diving-resort-ko-tao">Ban's</a>, which means that she's living and working here on Ko Tao for a few months. Abbie's been with my <a href="/blog/padi-diving-course-begins">Open Water</a> group over the past several days, and this is her first time as an instructor's assistant to a group of Open Water students. Great girl, and quite committed to her diving.</p>
