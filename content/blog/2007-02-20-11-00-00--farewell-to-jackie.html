<p>After the late night last night, I also had an early start this morning, to have breakfast with Jackie, and to say goodbye to her before she left for the airport. My first Mexican breakfast was standard enough: just toast, coffee, and orange juice. Not quite as exotic as last night's enchiladas, but hey, it did wake me up.</p>

<p>After Jackie left, I went back up to my hotel room, and decided to make the most of my big spend on a private room. Nice private shower, reading, etc. Then I checked out, and I was on my way. For the first time ever, I was completely alone in a foreign country; with all my worldly possessions on my back; with little idea about where I was, how to communicate with the locals, or what the hell I was going to do; and it felt absolutely fantastic!</p>
