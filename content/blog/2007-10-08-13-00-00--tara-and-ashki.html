<p>This super-nice married couple are best friends of my cousins, <a href="/blog/the-goldstein-bempechat-clan">the Goldsteins</a> &mdash; in fact, they're <em>so</em> incredibly super-nice, that they're letting my dad and myself stay in their house for two weeks, while we're here in Boston! Tara and Ashki haven't got any kids yet &mdash; but no doubt they'll be getting round to it, before too long. The couple are both studying (post-grad) at university this year, but they'll be getting back into the workforce come next year. Tara does a bit of work as a Hebrew teacher, and she helped Adam to prepare for his upcoming barmitzvah. Really friendly people, and full of warm <em>heimische</em> spirit.</p>
