<p>I've been here at the <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a> for a full week, and despite originally being peeved about being stuck here, I actually met some really great people here, and I'm going to miss them all. However, as of tonight, everyone here is either leaving Lima, or moving to another hostel; because the whole place has been booked out by a travelling circus.</p>
