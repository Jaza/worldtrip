<p>After nine nights at this place, I finally checked out and said goodbye to <a href="/blog/patanuk-hostel-bariloche">Patanuk</a> today. I'm very sad to be leaving: it's the cosiest hostel I've ever stayed at, and I feel like the staff and guests that I've been with over the past week have become my family. It's also sad, because quite a few people are leaving today or tomorrow: <a href="/blog/sarah-and-jordan">Sarah and Jordan</a>, along with <a href="/blog/simon-and-anna">Simon and Anna</a>, are heading off west to Chile (yeah, I know &mdash; <em>why?</em> :P); and <a href="/blog/ed-from-ireland">Ed</a> is following my tracks to Buenos Aires pretty soon. So Patanuk is going to be a house with all the children gone. Ah well, I'm sure they'll have a whole new family of guests by next week. Chao, Patanuk: it's been great!</p>
