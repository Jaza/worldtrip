Well, considering i'm not carrying the olympic flame, i dont really have any physical baton to pass on to you as I finish my 'tour' and you start your world trip so i'm just gunna say  my 2 pence. or riel if ur coming to Cambodia, which as a matter of a fact dont have coins or denominations lower than 50(just thought u'd like to know)

So yeah, i'm glad that my mum, Auntie Sue, has been conferring with ur mum, Jeremy's Mum, so that we will be reading each other's online 'secret' diaries. This way i'll know when u get to try those delicious deep fried cocharoaches, or steamed dog, or so i'm told. Or perhaps get hopelessly lost in the middle of Hanoi, and ending up walking off the map.

As for advice, try to keep ur blog updated at about twice a week, that is try not to go 3 weeks like i have with out a post haha! Also you might be surprised how bad the internet can be, especially if there happens to be an earthquake that cuts the major linking gateways to the region during ur trip... so as for uploading photos... consider yourself warned.

otherwise Enjoy!!
