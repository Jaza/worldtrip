<p><em>Antonio, head geek of Peru.</em></p>
<p>I feel that Antonio has become my <em>de facto</em> "guardian angel" for this trip: he connected me with Mauricio in Mexico; he's introduced me to tonnes of people here in Lima; and he has other contacts all over South America for me to meet! Talk about finding the right person at the right time.</p>
