<p>Delicious traditional Peruvian dish of chopped-up beef or lamb, fried potato chips, tomato, and some spices. Usually served with rice. This afternoon, <a href="/blog/juan-carlos">Juan Carlos</a> held a cooking class at the tiny kitchen at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>, and 5 of us cooked up and then ate some <em>lomo saltado</em>. It's really quite a simple dish, and it's very easy to make. I'll have to try cooking it up by myself sometime.</p>
