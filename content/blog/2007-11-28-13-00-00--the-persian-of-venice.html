<p>Nobody can ever remember this guy's name: but he's the guy who not only cooks the dinners at <a href="/blog/a-venice-fish-venice">A Venice Fish</a> every night; he also single-handedly runs the place, virtually 24/7, week after week. And as if all that wasn't enough: he's also a really friendly and sociable bloke, who enjoys taking his guests out on the town later on some nights, and showing them the best pubs and clubs. The Persian was very impressed that one of my best friends back in Sydney is from Iran, and that I can say one sentence in Persian: "tavalodet mobarak" (lit: "happy birthday").</p>
