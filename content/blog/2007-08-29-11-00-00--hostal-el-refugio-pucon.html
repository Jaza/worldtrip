<p>Started and run by a Dutch ex-pat and his wife &mdash; both of whom work as snowboarding instructors on Volcán Villarrica &mdash; <a href="http://www.hostalelrefugio.cl/">El Refugio</a> is a great little house-like hostel, in the middle of tiny Pucón. Always filled with backpackers, come down here to climb the volcano. Has a nice lounge room where you can sit by the fire, watch TV, lie in the hammock-seat, play darts, or share a bottle of red with your fellow guests. And as Pucón goes, it's very reasonably priced as well. Was recommended to me, and I recommend it to you as well.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> one cosy dorm with 6 beds, all fitted with thick doonas plus extra blankets (which are most welcome, around here in wintertime).</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> nice (if small) group of backpackers, most of whom are just passing through for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> Peter and his wife Lorena are a great and friendly couple, and the other helpers in the place are most hospitable as well.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> one block from the main street of town.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> no free food (except tea), but you're welcome to buy supplies from the supermarket down the road, and to cook whatever you want in the well-equipped kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 1 PC, available for unlimited use &mdash; if you're around during the day, you get it pretty much all to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> not reliable, in my attempt-to-shower experience here.</p>
