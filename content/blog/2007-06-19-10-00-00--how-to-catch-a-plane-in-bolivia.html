<p>Today, <a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a> and I flew back from Rurrenabaque to La Paz, with the affordable and reasonably-safe Transporte Aéreo Militar (TAM), the "military airline" of Bolivia. Slightly cheaper than Amaszonas, and just as efficient. After going through the experience of catching a plane in Bolivia twice now, I feel I should write up some instructions on how it's done, for anyone else who's interested in using Bolivia's fine commercial aviation services.</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy your plane tickets the day before you want to fly, preferably in the afternoon. The only available flight is the 8:30am flight, so take that one. Go in person, and pay in cash (preferably in US dollars).</li>
<li>Turn up at the airline's office at 7:30am the next morning, as instructed.</li>
<li>Wait &frac12; an hour for the airline office to open its doors. Check in your baggage.</li>
<li>After another &frac12; an hour, be informed that your flight will be delayed by about 2 hours.</li>
<li>Find a good café nearby, and have a nice, long breakfast. No hurry.</li>
<li>Return to the airline's office after 2 hours. Wait another &frac12; an hour, then catch the shuttle bus to the airport.</li>
<li>With no further information as to why the flight is delayed, wait another 1&frac12; hours in the airport.</li>
<li>Finally catch the plane, after a record extremely-short delay of only 4 hours.</li>
<li>Arrive back in La Paz, 3000m higher than the place you took off from, and almost pass out from lack of oxygen and from the sudden cold.</li>
</ol>
