<p>Kitzbühel's <a href="/blog/kitzbuhel-skiing-the-packed-finale">slopes were packed today</a>; and this evening, <a href="/blog/snowbunnys-hostel-kitzbuhel">Snowbunnys</a> was a lot busier as well. Seems that I really did sneak this ski trip in, just before the rush: because as of now, <em>The Rush&trade;</em> has officially arrived. We had a number of new arrivals in the hostel last night, and even more tonight. Apparently, still more guests are due in tomorrow &mdash; and the hostel is going to be 100% booked out over the weekend.</p>
<p>Some of the newbies at the hostel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>South African couple.</strong> I haven't met all that many South Africans on my travels (not nearly as many as I meet back in Sydney!); but when they do pass my way, they're <em>hoord tue msss, menn.</em> The new couple from Cape Town are very friendly: they described to us how Capetonians save money on booze back home, by buying all their alcohol for the night at a liquor store, driving to a club, and then having a "car bar" in the carpark (i.e. using the boot as their bar).</li>
<li><strong>Rachel from NYC.</strong> Friendly girl who's a keen skier, and who lives in an apartment in Manhattan (first Manhattan-dweller I've met who doesn't complain too much about the rent).</li>
<li><strong>Helen and "other half".</strong> Nice English couple who have been doing a round-the-world blitz for the past 8 weeks. The "other half" doesn't say much &mdash; Helen does most of the talking.</li>
<li><strong>New English mob.</strong> Not sure exactly how many there are in this group of Pommy friends, but I think about 4 (2 guys 2 girls?). One of the guys cracked me up last night, by announcing at about 12:30am that he was starving, and that he was going outside to find a hot "bosna" (Austrian hot dog).</li>
<li><strong>Pair of German girls.</strong> Two lovely girls from Cologne, one of everyone's favourite German cities. They're just here for a few days to get in a bit of skiing.</li>
</ul>
