<p>A good Thai curry is pretty hard to come by in South America (although on occasion, <a href="/blog/thai-and-indian-in-la-paz">it can be found</a>), so I've been suffering some serious Thai withdrawal. That's why tonight, for dinner in the city where any and every cuisine is available 24/7, I couldn't help but go for Thai. Went to a little joint up near the bottom of Central Park, on 9<sup>th</sup> Ave, and got some great chicken and stir-fried vegies, in a spicy coconut-milk soup. I'll save the Indian for when I get to London. And I'll save more Thai for... well, for Thailand!</p>

<p>I was thinking of going out and doing the backpacker thing tonight, as I've done so many times on this trip: you know &mdash; bars, drinks, random friends, all that stuff. But I couldn't be bothered, and I'm really up for a break from that kind of life (for a bit); and anyway, doing that in New York is a bit pricey for my liking. So I just went for a walk this evening, up to Central Park and back. New York has ridiculously warm weather at the moment &mdash; seriously, it's October, and it's hotter here than it was in <em>Rio</em>, what the hell is going on! &mdash; so an evening stroll in Manhattan seemed quite attractive.</p>
<p>New York has a plethora of options for eating out. The most common cuisine of all seems to be Mexican: while I can't say I wasn't tempted by a round of tacos, I didn't find it as alluring as Thai &mdash; after all, I had a whole month of tacos down in Mexico; and I seriously doubt that anything up here in the US would be nearly as good as the <em>real</em> thing. Mexican in New York would have inevitably led to disappointment. There's also a lot of other Asian cuisine available &mdash; with plain 'ol Chinese being the most abundant, and with sushi joints, Korean places, and Malay-style noodle bars following not-too-far behind &mdash; but once again, none of it could compete with the Thai; and really, Asian in general isn't what you go to New York for. There are plenty of better cities in the world for that &mdash; with Sydney being a prime example.</p>
<p>On another note, it's good to see that &mdash; despite now having a big hole in the ground at its downtown end &mdash; New York is still the same loud, rude, anything-goes, international melting-pot that I remember it being, when I visited seven years ago. They might have blown up a building or two since I was here last, but New York's crazy heart and soul lives on with barely a scratch. Even just by visiting for a day or two, and walking around on the streets, you can really appreciate what a beautiful and unrivalled hodge-podge of culture and personality this city is. I'd hate for that beauty to ever die &mdash; and indeed, I hope it never does.</p>
