<p>I told myself that after Argentina, I was done with massive all-you-can-eat barbeque dinners. Well, so much for that &mdash; tonight's sizzling grill at <a href="/blog/aquario-ilha-grande">Aquario</a> was simply too good to resist. Juicy cuts of steak, phat <em>chorizo</em> sausages, and blackened local fish was just the beginning &mdash; we also had a line-up of every accompaniment you could ever ask for, and more. My final bottle of Argentinean Malbec red wine went down great with <a href="/blog/las-tres-argentinas">the <abbr title="Buenos Aires">BA</abbr> girls</a>. And the free <em>caipirinha</em> went down great with me.</p>

<p>Dinner, followed by more dinner, followed by more drinks &mdash; sheer gluttonous pleasure.</p>
