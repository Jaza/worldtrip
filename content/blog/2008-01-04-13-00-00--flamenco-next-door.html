<p>This evening, <a href="/blog/aussies-of-barcelona">Deanna</a> and I went to see a Flamenco show here in Barcelona. Flamenco is that most famous of Spanish dancing: you know the one, with the Riverdance-like foot-tapping, and the women in long flowing dresses, and the hairy guys twiddling cheesily on their guitars. It was very convenient &mdash; it's right next door to the <a href="/blog/kabul-hostel-barcelona">Kabul hostel</a> &mdash; and what's more, the show is free for all Kabul guests! The performance was beautiful, dramatic, stern, and yet fun &mdash; a combination that nobody can pull off quite like the Spanish can. The jug of <em>sangria</em> that we ordered wasn't bad, either. We caught the 9:30pm show, which was just as well: because the 10:30pm one was totally packed-out.</p>
