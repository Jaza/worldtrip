<p>All the hostels here in Mexico give you coffee with your breakfast. I usually don't drink coffee at all, because I hate the taste, and because I don't like the idea of becoming a caffeine addict. But lately, I've started drinking the hostel coffee. Here's a few reasons why.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's there.</li>
<li>It's free.</li>
<li>It's hot.</li>
<li>It's boiled, so the water is free of germs. That means a bit less bottled water that I have to buy.</li>
<li>I'm getting used to the taste.</li>
<li>I don't think it's very strong (it doesn't make my hands shake, like caf√© coffee does).</li>
<li>Peer pressure (and <em>no</em>, this doesn't mean that if everyone in the hostel snorts cocaine for breakfast, I'll do that too!).</li>
<li>There's no tea; or (more likely) I'm too lazy to look for the tea.</li>
</ol>
