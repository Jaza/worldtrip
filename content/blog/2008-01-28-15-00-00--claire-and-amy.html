<p>Claire and Amy are two young ladies from the city of Leeds, in fair old Mother England. Claire has been doing the <a href="/blog/padi-diving-course-begins">Open Water course</a> with me for the past four days, so she knows me and everyone else in the crew. Her friend Amy declined to partake in the diving &mdash; "it's not my thing", she said &mdash; however, this hasn't stopped her from getting in on the social side of <a href="/blog/bans-diving-resort-ko-tao">Ban's</a>, so we all know her as well. Lovely girls, and they've been here in southern Thailand so long, and their tan is so dark, that they're looking less English every day.</p>
