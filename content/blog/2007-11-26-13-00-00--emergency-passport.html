<p>There are some things that are expendable while travelling, and others that are essential.

A few hours and €90 later, and what do you know: my passport is ready, new as can be, and (for the short 6 months that it's valid) as good as the real thing. It was a hassle and a ripoff: but what can I do? I can't leave the country without a passport; I can't even go elsewhere within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (although in reality, there's no border control here in Europe). I'll try to be more careful with this one, than I was with the last one.</p>
