<p>Just after lunch this afternoon, and just before our <a href="/blog/jungle-handicraft-making">handicraft-making session</a>, our guide <a href="/blog/orlando-the-jungle-guide">Orlando</a> heard the noise of pigs nearby, and quickly gathered us and led us on a sprint through the trees, in the direction of the noise. When we reached the spot, we were just in time to witness about 100 wild pigs running past us in a mad stampede. Fairly common occurrence, apparently &mdash; but you still have to be both fast and lucky to actually witness it. Not sure what the pigs were stampeding after, either: maybe someone struck mud?</p>
