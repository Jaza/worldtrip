<p><em>Interesting photos from the Chiclayo area, 100 years ago. You can see how some things have changed &mdash; the local clothes, the local infrastructure, etc &mdash; but how other things havent, e.g. the traditional food and drink, and the big families.</em></p>

<p><em>Freaky mummy from Moche times.</em></p>
<p>The main focus of the museum is on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche">Moche</a> civilisation, the group that was based in the Chiclayo area c. 500 AD, and from which the famous tomb of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Se%C3%B1or_de_Sip%C3%A1n">Señor de Sipán</a> was discovered. But it also covers various other groups that lived in the area, including the Wari, and eventually the Incas.</p>
<p>The Brüning is the less-visited of the two important museums that are located in Lambayeque. Many people give it a miss, and choose to instead head straight to the <a href="http://www.tumbasreales.org/">Museo Tumbas Reales de Sipán</a>, where the treasure from El Señor de Sipán is housed. I chose to do the opposite. Not sure why &mdash; but turned out to be not such a bad choice, as the Brüning museum is quite interesting.</p>
