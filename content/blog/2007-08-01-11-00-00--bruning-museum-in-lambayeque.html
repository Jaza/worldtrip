<p>Along with my friend <a href="/blog/kate-the-healer">Kate</a>, I caught a <em>combi</em> from Chiclayo to the nearby town of Lambayeque today, and had a look inside the famous Brüning museum. Named after the turn-of-the-20<sup>th</sup>-century photographer and artefacts collector, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Heinrich_Br%C3%BCning_Brookstedt">Hans Heinrich Brüning</a> (who lived in the area for many years), the museum is filled with beautiful relics from the Pre-Inca civilisations that dwelt in the Chiclayo area &mdash; many of which are pure gold &mdash; as well as photos from the area 100 years ago. Nice place to look around, and not overly touristed either.</p>

<p>The main focus of the museum is on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche">Moche</a> civilisation, the group that was based in the Chiclayo area c. 500 AD, and from which the famous tomb of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Se%C3%B1or_de_Sip%C3%A1n">Señor de Sipán</a> was discovered. But it also covers various other groups that lived in the area, including the Wari, and eventually the Incas.

<p>The Brüning is the less-visited of the two important museums that are located in Lambayeque. Many people give it a miss, and choose to instead head straight to the <a href="http://www.tumbasreales.org/">Museo Tumbas Reales de Sipán</a>, where the treasure from El Señor de Sipán is housed. I chose to do the opposite. Not sure why &mdash; but turned out to be not such a bad choice, as the Brüning museum is quite interesting.</p>
