<p>At <em>Don Muchos</em> tonight, I decided to order myself a little Margarita after I finished my dinner. I don't know what the hell they put in that drink, but it must have been damn strong; because that was the only alcoholic beverage I had tonight, and it put me right out like a light bulb. I didn't even make it back to the hammock: I dozed right off at the dinner table, and I missed most of tonight's juggling show.</p>

<p>It did taste good, though. Nice strong lime, cool but not frozen, with bits of salt on the edge of the glass.</p>
