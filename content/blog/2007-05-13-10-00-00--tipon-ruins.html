<p>After yesterday's visit to the ruins of <a href="/blog/pisac-ruins-morning">Pisac</a> and <a href="/blog/ollantaytambo-fortress">Ollantaytambo</a> in the <em>Valle Sagrado</em> (north of Cusco), today <a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a> and I continued this weekend's ruin-seeking crusade, by heading south of Cusco, to the town and the Incan ruins of Tipón. Although I was still recovering from <a href="/blog/the-buffet-that-rose-again">yesterday's lethal buffet lunch</a>, I was well enough today to make it to these ruins, and to appreciate the ingenious work that the Incas carried out here, hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p><em>The town and some of the ruins of Tipón, as seen from the very top.</em></p>
<p>As you can see, the setup for Tipón is similar to that for Pisac (i.e. the ruins are a long way uphill from the town), only even more so. And today, Jesus and I were even less inclined to make an arduous trek up a mountain (yeh, I know &mdash; despite all the ruins, it's turned into a very lazy weekend!). So once again, it was up to the ruins themselves via shared taxi.</p>
<p>Tipón is famous for being the site of an ancient Incan irrigation system. It's quite ingenious what they did around here: they completely redirected a nearby mountain stream, and constructed a series of stone waterways and waterfalls, to water the crops in the complex, and to provide running water for drinking and sanitation. As with Pisac, it's all grass now &mdash; but back in the day, the site was covered in local vegies.</p>

<p><em>Ancient irrigation system at Tipón.</em></p>
<p>Although I was the sick (but recovering) one, today Jesus was the (only) hung-over one; so Jesus decided to go to sleep on the grass, in the main part of the Tipón ruins, while I continued climbing and exploring the hillside that rises up and that overlooks the site. I went a fair way up, and from several vantage points, I got a great view of the ruins sprawled out below.</p>

<p>As well as being an impressive set of ruins, Tipón is also a great, grassy place to relax and to hang out on a sunny day. With their free entry, plenty of local families were camped out here for a Sunday picnic. Jesus and I decided to join in the chilling and the relaxation: after I returned from my mountainside exploration, we had a good, long, and very close game of chess on the grass (Jesus won this time).</p>
