<p>As you can see, the setup for Tipón is similar to that for Pisac (i.e. the ruins are a long way uphill from the town), only even more so. And today, Jesus and I were even less inclined to make an arduous trek up a mountain (yeh, I know &mdash; despite all the ruins, it's turned into a very lazy weekend!). So once again, it was up to the ruins themselves via shared taxi.

<p>Tipón is famous for being the site of an ancient Incan irrigation system. It's quite ingenious what they did around here: they completely redirected a nearby mountain stream, and constructed a series of stone waterways and waterfalls, to water the crops in the complex, and to provide running water for drinking and sanitation. As with Pisac, it's all grass now &mdash; but back in the day, the site was covered in local vegies.

<p>Although I was the sick (but recovering) one, today Jesus was the (only) hung-over one; so Jesus decided to go to sleep on the grass, in the main part of the Tipón ruins, while I continued climbing and exploring the hillside that rises up and that overlooks the site. I went a fair way up, and from several vantage points, I got a great view of the ruins sprawled out below.

<p>As well as being an impressive set of ruins, Tipón is also a great, grassy place to relax and to hang out on a sunny day. With their free entry, plenty of local families were camped out here for a Sunday picnic. Jesus and I decided to join in the chilling and the relaxation: after I returned from my mountainside exploration, we had a good, long, and very close game of chess on the grass (Jesus won this time).</p>
