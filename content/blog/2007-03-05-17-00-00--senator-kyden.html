<p>Ran into Kyden at <em>The Weary Traveler</em>, and he, myself, and Steve (Cody couldn't make it) ended up hanging out together in Tulum for a bit. Like my good friend <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Arthur+Cheng%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryAU">Arthur Cheng</a> back home, there's something about Kyden that screams "future national leader". Maybe it's the law degree he's getting a Georgetown Uni in D.C; or the way he always appears to be either listening intently to someone, or answering their questions (with the accuracy of these <em>appearances</em> being questionable); or the way he jumps into things with confidence and enthusiasm.</p>
