<p>As anyone who's ever been to Cologne (<abbr title="Also Known As">aka</abbr> Köln) should know, the city's famous hallmark beer is a brand called Kölsch. There are several competing brews available, but all of them are served in tradional little "shot glasses", completely fresh and straight out of the barrel. After dinner this evening, my friend <a href="/blog/reunion-with-regine">Regine</a> took me to one of the better Kölsch bars in town, and we had time to down a few glasses of the stuff and to have a little chat, before Regine had to head back home to Bonn. Great-tasting stuff.</p>
