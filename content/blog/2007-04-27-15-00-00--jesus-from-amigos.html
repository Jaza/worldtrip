<p>Jesus is the founder and the director of <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>, and he's a very complicated guy. He has enormous talent, diligence, and ambition; yet he has many fears, doubts, and dilemnas to contend with. He genuinely wants to help and to serve the kids that he works with; yet he also indulges in the luxuries of high-class Cusco that most locals cannot enjoy. And he's technically the boss, above and in charge of everyone around him; yet the people around him are his best friends, closer than his family, and he hangs out with them and parties with them, and he treats and respects all as his equals.</p>

<p><em>Jesus may be an intriguing and multi-faceted man, but he loves a good torta (cake) as much as the next guy.</em></p>
