<p>Steven bought this while we were <a href="/blog/alaska-airlines-flight-599">waiting for our flight to Vancouver</a>, in the terminal at San Francisco airport. It looks like a diluted kind of orange-juice drink, but it proudly proclaims on the label: <em>"contains no juice"</em>. Wow, a drink with no juice &mdash; just what I was looking for! No juice at all, eh? That's pretty extreme: even more so than, for example, <em>"may contain traces of juice"</em>. I tell you what: I'm leaving this crazy country real soon, but it's not soon enough.</p>
