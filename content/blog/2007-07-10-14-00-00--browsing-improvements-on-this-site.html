<p>Dear visitors,</p>
<p>As of today, this site has received a number of minor enhancements, in order to improve the ease of browsing through my numerous blog entries. I hope that you will find the following new features on the site convenient:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is now a <a href="/blog/monthly-archive">monthly archive</a> of all blog entries. You can view all blog entries for each month (grouped by day) on a single page! Should make it much easier to catch up on older blog entries, and to keep track of which entries you have and haven't read. Also provides fixed pages from which you can access all the entries, rather than the reverse chronological listing, where the entries on each page number change constantly.</li>
<li>At the bottom of each blog entry (the full entry, not the summary), there is now a link to the previous and next entries (according to date and time). So you can now "cruise" from one blog entry to the next, without having to keep going back to the index pages.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p>Additionally, the blog is now more up-to-date than it has been in over two months (for the first time since then, it is actually completely current), due to a combination of my having a fair bit of free time, and a lot of cheap and fast Internet in the past few days.</p>
<p>I've also updated the 'about' page to have a bit more information, particularly about the features of the site's various sections. Hope you like these little improvements to the site, and be sure to come back and to keep reading!</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> these changes were made in an Internet cafe in Arequipa, Peru &mdash; not the easiest place in the world to do web development. Further improvements to the site are not likely in the near future, as it is very hard to find the time or the resources to make them, while I'm on the road in South America!</p>
