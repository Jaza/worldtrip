<p>Had a random reunion here at the <a href="/blog/the-green-tortoise">Green Tortoise</a>: bumped into <a href="/blog/karl-and-james">Karl from London</a>, who I last saw back in <a href="/locations/mexico/merida">Mérida</a>, in south-eastern Mexico.

<p>But he said that Cancun was a bit disappointing: overpriced, and not nearly as much fun as advertised. Ah well, I guess he should have gone to Tulum instead!</p>
<p>He's just come from Vegas, and he's not sure where he's going after SF.</p>
