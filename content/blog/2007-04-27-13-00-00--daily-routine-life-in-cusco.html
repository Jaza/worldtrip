<p>Over the past week, I've put my usual travel life of uncertainty, adventure, and mobility on hold for a bit, and I'm back in a routine daily grind. It's essential that I do this, in order to spend some time studying and learning; but I sure am glad that I don't have to do it all year, like I've done every year for the past 16 years of my life! It's a good reminder of how much cooler backpacking is than working or studying.</p>

<p>Over the past week, I've put my usual travel life of uncertainty, adventure, and mobility on hold for a bit, and I'm back in a routine daily grind. It's essential that I do this, in order to spend some time studying and learning; but I sure am glad that I don't have to do it all year, like I've done every year for the past 16 years of my life! It's a good reminder of how much cooler backpacking is than working or studying.</p>
<p>My routine is fairly simple. I get up at about 6:30am, I get myself ready, I have breakfast, and I'm out the door by 7:30am or earlier. Then, it's at least a 35-minute walk (<a href="/blog/getting-around-in-cusco">not bus or taxi</a>) from home to school. Classes are from 8am-12pm. I usually go on the 'Net for an hour or so after class, at one of the nearby <em>cabinas</em> (Internet caf√©s); then it's back home for lunch <a href="/blog/staying-with-the-polar-covarrubias-family">with the family</a>.</p>
<p>Between lunch and dinner, I usually have most or all of the afternoon to myself. I spend the afternoons reading, going online, and doing my homework. So far, there have also been extra-curricular activities with <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a> on most afternoons, which can take up some or all of my time. Then, it's dinner with the family, and usually an early tuck in to bed at about 9:30-10pm.</p>
<p>I'm pretty happy with this routine, and I think I can keep it up for 4 weeks without problems. After all, I'm in a nice part of a nice city, with a nice school and a nice family; and I chose to be here, and every day I'm learning lots, and I'm doing what I want to be doing with my life. Also, of course, I'll be having the weekends to myself, and I'll be able to (pretty much) do whatever I want then, whenever I want. But it sure will also be good to break the routine at the end, and to return to a spontaneous, unstructured life on the road.</p>
