<p>This hostel has the best communal set-up, and hence the best communal atmosphere, of anywhere I've stayed so far. The central courtyard, which dominates the place, houses a long row of tables, a few hammocks, a deluxe (and used-by-all) kitchen, and a bar. I met some great people here, and felt that I could really unwind as well.</p>
