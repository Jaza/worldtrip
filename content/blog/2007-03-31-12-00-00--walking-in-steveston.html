<p>For my final few hours in Vancouver this afternoon, Genna took me on a little tour of the Steveston Village area. This is a beautiful little wharf and seafood spot, nestled at the very bottom of Richmond Island, and overlooking the Gulf of Georgia. It's also apparently the oldest part of Vancouver. This is where Vancouver started, as little more than a modest fishing village. There are great restaurants, great cafés, and great ice-cream shops along the boardwalk here.</p>

<p><em>Genna and myself at the wharf.</em></p>
<p>Got some real tasty ice-cream on the wharf here. Also looked through some of the souvenir shops, and got myself a few funny Canadian fridge magnets.</p>
