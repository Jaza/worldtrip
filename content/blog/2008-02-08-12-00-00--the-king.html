<p>As anybody who's visited this country should be acutely aware of, Thailand is still a kingdom. A constitutional monarchy, to be precise: much like Great Britain's setup, where the king (or queen) is still technically the head of state, but where said king / queen actually retains very little power. In Thailand, however &mdash; unlike in most other surviving 12<sup>st</sup>-century monarchies &mdash; it's virtually impossible to <em>not</em> notice the fact that they have a king. They absolutely <strong>ADORE</strong> him! The king's photo is on every street corner, framed in gold and lit-up like a superstar. Speaking ill against the king is highly inadvisable: not only is it illegal; it also has about a 99% chance of pi$$ing off <em>any</em> local that you may encounter. All hail the king: he's pretty hot stuff around here.</p>
