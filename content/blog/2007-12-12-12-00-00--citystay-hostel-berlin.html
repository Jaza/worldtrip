<p><a href="http://citystay-hostel.eu/en/">CityStay</a>'s a very clean, very secure, very modern hostel, and it's in a great central location in Berlin. Unfortunately, it suffers from one big <a href="/blog/the-trouble-with-european-hostels">common European hostel problem</a>: it's often full of school groups. Fortunately, however, it does have a great bar and common area, which makes it easy to meet the other (minority) real backpackers staying there. Excellent value, and especially recommended if you're not after a crazy party hostel.</p>

<p><a href="http://citystay-hostel.eu/en/">CityStay</a>'s a very clean, very secure, very modern hostel, and it's in a great central location in Berlin. Unfortunately, it suffers from one big <a href="/blog/the-trouble-with-european-hostels">common European hostel problem</a>: it's often full of school groups. Fortunately, however, it does have a great bar and common area, which makes it easy to meet the other (minority) real backpackers staying there. Excellent value, and especially recommended if you're not after a crazy party hostel.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> clean, secure (they give you über-cool <abbr title="Radio Frequency ID">RFID</abbr> credit-card-sized keys, which you wave to enter), warm and quiet.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> too many school groups! And many of the other guests there are in big groups as well &mdash; big enough to keep to themselves. There are <em>some</em> proper backpackers here, though, so don't despair.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> quite easy-going, and usually willing to help you.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> in Berlin's Mitte district, one block from the Alexanderplatz station and shopping complex, and walking-distance from key sights such as the Brandenburg Gate.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> the excellent buffet breakfast is meant to cost €4, but they don't enforce the price very strictly &mdash; I pigged out for free while I was here. Lunch and dinner also available, but it's a ripoff &mdash; <a href="/blog/berlin-bargain-bonanza">plenty of better options</a> abound nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> numerous PCs in the lobby for €2/hr, which is rather a ripoff, <a href="/blog/berlin-bargain-bonanza">especially by Berlin standards</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> hot and reliable &mdash; although the whack-to-use and whack-to-keep-using water-saving taps are annoying. Bathrooms are also very clean and are numerous.</p>
