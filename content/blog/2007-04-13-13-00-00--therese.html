<p>Therese is one of the many seldom-sober Irish girls that are staying at <a href="/blog/loki-hostel-cusco">Loki</a>. Therese has been here for about a month, she's starting work at the hostel, and she has no immediate plans to leave. Tonight, when we took Therese to Uptown for a big night, she kept going until 6am. The staff had to kick us out of the club, because we were the last ones there. We ended up virtually carrying Therese back to Loki.</p>
