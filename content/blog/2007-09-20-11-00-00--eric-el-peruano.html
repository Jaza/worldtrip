<p>My meeting Eric is one of the most random things that's happened to me on this trip. I went into a bar-slash-hamburger place this evening, just to grab a quick <em>choripan</em> (hot dog); and what do you know? I ended up talking to Eric (originally from Lima, now living here in <abbr title="Buenos Aires">BA</abbr>), and his alcoholic friend from Mendoza, at the bar. Four hours and about 5 <em>Quilmes</em> beers later, we were still talking. Eric's a computer technician: he wanted me to teach him how to program and to "be a hacker" (what, now? :P), but I suggested that coming back to <a href="/blog/hostel-clan-ba">The Clan</a> for some more beers would be a better idea.</p>
