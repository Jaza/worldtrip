<p>I was up for a nice, quiet day of relaxing and reading today, after yesterday's <a href="/blog/stroll-up-volcan-villarrica">adventure on the volcano</a>. So I'm walking down the street in Pucón, heading to the lakeside with a good book, when this guy comes up to me and invites me to join his friends on the grass. His name was Francisco, or "Chisco": and like his friends hanging out on the grass, he was completely trashed. It was the middle of the day, and they were all downing beers and smoking weed. <em>"Do you wanna be boring, or do you wanna have fun, maaan?"</em> Chisco demanded.</p>

<p>I was up for a nice, quiet day of relaxing and reading today, after yesterday's <a href="/blog/stroll-up-volcan-villarrica">adventure on the volcano</a>. So I'm walking down the street in Pucón, heading to the lakeside with a good book, when this guy comes up to me and invites me to join his friends on the grass. His name was Francisco, or "Chisco": and like his friends hanging out on the grass, he was completely trashed. It was the middle of the day, and they were all downing beers and smoking weed. <em>"Do you wanna be boring, or do you wanna have fun, maaan?"</em> Chisco demanded.</p>
<p>Anyway, Chisco was pretty insistent that I not go off and read my book (because you're not allowed to do boring things like that in the middle of the day, on a lazy Friday), so I accepted his invitiation, and hung out with these drunk, stoned tourguides (day off) for a bit, before they all fell asleep in the park. Welcome to a small town somewhere in Chile, eh? :P</p>
