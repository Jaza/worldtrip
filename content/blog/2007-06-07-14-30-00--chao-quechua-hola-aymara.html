<p>On the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca, they speak Quechua &mdash; just like in Cusco, and in most of the highlands of Peru &mdash; the language of the Incas. But here on the Bolivian side, they speak <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_language">Aymara</a>, the language of the <em>altiplano</em> ("high plains"). Apparently, the lake is not just the border between two countries. It's also the border between two languages, and between the two ancient cultures behind them. Looks like I won't be needing my Quechua phrasebook anymore (not that it helped, anyway &mdash; Quechua is downright impossible to learn).</p>
