<p>I lost many valuable items when I got <a href="/blog/the-italian-night-train-job">robbed on the train</a> last week. One item that I particularly missed was my Wenger Swiss Army knife, which <a href="/blog/mark-and-susi">uncle Mark</a> brought me as a present, on his last visit to Sydney 7 years ago. When Mark heard about the loss of the knife, he insisted on remedying the situation, and on doing what all good Swiss uncles with Aussie nephews do: he bought me yet another army knife. This time, a Victorinox, and one of the fancier and more full-featured models. Hopefully I'll get many years of good use out of this baby, just as I did out of the previous one.</p>
