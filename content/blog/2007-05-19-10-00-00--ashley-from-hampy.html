<p>Ashley is a Canadian girl with a marketing background, who's here in Cusco for about 2 months, helping <a href="http://hampy.org/">Hampy</a> with various aspects of their publicity. I first met Ashley about 2 weeks ago, on the <a href="/blog/chocco-and-hampy-tour">Chocco and Hampy tour</a>, and from now on I'm going to be working pretty closely with her on the new Hampy web site. She has a dry but witty sense of humour, and she can sure as hell let her hair down and party, when the occasion calls for it.</p>

<p><em>Ashley relaxing on some rocks, in Moray.</em></p>
<p>This afternoon, I met up with Ashley, and we went to a caf√© near the Plaza to discuss the structure of the new site. Neither of us was feeling very good &mdash; Ashley has a pretty bad flu; and after a premature big night last night, my diarrhoea has returned yet again with a vengeance &mdash; but we still managed to sit down and to get a fair bit sorted out. We also went (with various other Hampy people) to visit Chocco again this afternoon, and to sit in on another of <a href="/blog/terese">Terese</a>'s English classes.</p>
