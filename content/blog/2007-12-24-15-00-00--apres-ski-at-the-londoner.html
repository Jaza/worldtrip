I tried out the Snowbunnys après-ski shower for the first time, and I was impressed. Us Aussies cooked up some shared pasta napolitana (with a side of mash) for dinner, which was delicious and quite filling. And once again (<a href="/blog/welcome-to-kitzbuhel">like last night</a>), we hit The Londoner pub once more, for a couple of drinks and a quick shmooze.</p>

<p>I heard all about Craig, Sarah and Kades' adventures today: sounds like despite the ice, and despite being utter newbies, they still had plenty of fun. Their all-day lessons went very well: their instructors were very nice, spoke great English, and got through a fair bit of the basics with them. However, they're still very much at rock-bottom skill level, and they're not feeling confident to go all the way up the mountain yet. So I'm not sure if I'll be taking them up Hahnenkamm tomorrow: it'll probably have to wait until Wednesday (which is their last day here).</p>
