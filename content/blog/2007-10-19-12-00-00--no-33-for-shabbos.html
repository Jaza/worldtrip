<p>My <a href="/blog/dad">dad</a> and I returned to the <a href="/blog/the-goldstein-bempechat-clan">Goldsteins</a> this evening, where the 6 of us went down the road to the Main St of Newton Center, and where we observed Erev Shabbat at one of the area's fine Chinese noodle restaurants. The Chicken Laksa was superb. No better way to honour G-d's creations, and to observe his commandment of rest on the seventh day, than over a big bowl of Malaysian curry soup. That's my interpretation, anyway. So, as they say at the famous <em>Noodle King</em> of Lane Cove, it was time for some "Number Tertee-Tree, Pleess!"</p>
