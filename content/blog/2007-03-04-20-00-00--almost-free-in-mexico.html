<p>Of all the ridiculous things that street vendors say in order to get your attention, this one peeves me off the most. <em>"Hey amigo, you like this necklace? 100 pesos, 10 dollars &mdash; almost free!"</em> It's tacky; it's insulting (to people's intelligence); and it's completely untrue. But I guess it does the job of luring in those American prey, and their <em>almost smellable</em> dollars.</p>
