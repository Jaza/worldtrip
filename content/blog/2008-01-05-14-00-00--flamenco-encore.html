<p><a href="/blog/flamenco-next-door">Last night's Flamenco</a> was so good, I just had to go see it again. The fact that it was still free, and still next door, also provided plenty of incentive. My friend <a href="/blog/aussies-of-barcelona">Deanna</a> (and her buddy Jenny) left this morning; but I had a new crowd to take along to teh show tonight, including my mate <a href="/blog/siciliano-of-barcelona">the Sicilian</a>. Tonight's show was very similar, but somewhat different: about 2 of the 5 performers were new; and most of the songs and dances were also new. However, the style and the ambiance were identical to that of the first performance. Once again, great fun and a very impressive show.</p>
