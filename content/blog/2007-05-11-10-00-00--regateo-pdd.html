<p>For Latin Americans, it's <em>deporte</em> ("sport" &mdash; although not as important as <em>fútbol</em>, of course). For Israelis, it's <em>chai</em> ("life"). For Asians, it's <em>special price today, too dollar for you</em>. For everyone, it's <em>regateo</em> ("bargaining"). Australians like myself are generally not the world's most adept <em>regateadores</em> ("bargainers"), but most (including myself) improve rapidly after a visit to <em>paises del regateo</em> ("countries of bargaining"). After Mexico and Peru, I can definitely say that <em>ahora regateo más duro que hice antes</em> ("I bargain harder now than I did before"). If you're thinking of coming here, plan on improving your skills at <em>regateo</em> too.</p>
