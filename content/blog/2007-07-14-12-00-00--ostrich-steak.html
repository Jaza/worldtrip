<p>There's a great restaurant in Arequipa, called Zig Zag (in Calle Zela, near <a href="/blog/monasterio-de-santa-catalina">the monastery</a>), that's famous for doing ostrich steak. It's not cheap, but if you're up for a delicious and carnivorous meal, then it's more than worth it. Beautifully grilled, and served with salad, and chips / baked potato (plus about five different sauces). This was my first time having ostrich: it has quite a strong and tangy taste; but the meat is tender and delicious. Great feed.</p>
