<p>I found a little semi-street-vendor restaurant for lunch today, in downtown Chiang Mai, where they serve a delicious 20B Pad Thai. When I sat down and tucked in, a local kid sat down at the table next to me. He indicated that he was hungry and that he hadn't had lunch, and he asked me for 20B. I sympathised with the poor kid being hungry; but I know the rule: "if someone says they're hungry, don't give 'em money &mdash; give 'em food." So instead of giving <em>him</em> the 20B, I gave it to the restaurant lady, and asked her to cook up another Pad Thai for the kid. He didn't seem very happy about this &mdash; clearly he wasn't hungry, and he wanted the money for something else &mdash; but stuff that, if he wants lunch then a plate of noodles couldn't do him any harm.</p>
