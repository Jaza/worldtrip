<p>Home-made chocolates are a famous regional speciality of Bariloche. Although Argentina in general is not known for having great chocolate, this part of the country is an exception. This afternoon, I treated myself to two boxes of the stuff from <a href="http://www.mamuschka.com/">Mamuschka</a>, one of the finest chocolate boutiques in town. I managed to preserve one box, but the other one was devoured by the <a href="/blog/patanuk-hostel-bariloche">Patanuk</a> crew for dessert this evening.</p>
