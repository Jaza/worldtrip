<p>We started by being led by one of the people in our host family (the eldest daughter, aged 26 &mdash; why she's not married yet?) to the town square of Amantaní, where we met up with our fellow <em>gringos</em>, and took in the unfettered, virtually commerce-free atmosphere of the place with great pleasure.

<p>Then, we began the arduous hike up the big mountain that forms the centre of the island. It wasn't such a bad hike, really &mdash; only about &frac12; an hour long, and with a wide cobbled path all the way &mdash; but I guess the altitude was pretty severe. Anyway, there were plenty of great views all the way up, of the island and the gorgeous lake all around.

<p>Actually, that's not true: there was plenty to drink. When we reached the top, some great, ice-cold, only slightly over-priced Cusqueña beer awaited us.

<p>There really is nothing like having a good beer at the top of a mountain. Warms you up for the gathering cold. Helps you appreciate the beauty at the top. And dispels your fears about rolling all the way back down :P. In this case, it sure was beautiful at the top.</p>
