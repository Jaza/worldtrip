<p>Over the past three days, I've spent a lot of time working on the new English content for the <a href="http://www.spanishcusco.com/">Amigos web site</a>.

<p>Over the past three days, I've spent a lot of time working on the new English content for the <a href="http://www.spanishcusco.com/">Amigos web site</a>. I've gotten a lot written, but there's still a fair bit more to do. However, I'm afraid that I won't be doing the rest. Due to an unexpected clash of personalities in the office, my time spent volunteering for <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a> has come to an end. I'm happy with what I've accomplished here, but I can do no more.</p>
<p>This afternoon, <a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a> thanked me for my work, and asked me not to come in and do any more work for Amigos. Jesus and I have become good friends over the past month; but basically, when it comes to working together, our personalities clash badly. When I'm doing work &mdash; especially voluntary work &mdash; I require a reasonable amount of freedom in terms of how I work, what I work on, and when I work. Unfortunately, Jesus has a very controlling and dominant personality, and he just can't handle giving his people that much freedom. He also has a habit of treating volunteers just like his real employees, which I find quite difficult, and even insulting.</p>
<p>So that's all the volunteering I'll be doing for Amigos. I will, of course, continue to work voluntarily for <a href="/blog/hampy-web-site-work-begins">Hampy</a>, where they have no-one else with my skills, and where I have all the freedom that I need (<a href="/blog/jorge-from-hampy">Jorge</a> is a very relaxed boss). Hopefully, Jesus will be able to find someone else with good English skills, and with a different style of working, to finish off the content for the Amigos site.</p>
