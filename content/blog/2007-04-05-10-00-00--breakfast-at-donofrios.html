<p>As part of our board at the <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a>, we get free breakfast each morning at the D'onofrio café, which is just downstairs. However, D'onofrio's "free menu" is rather limited: either toast and jam; toast and egg; or fruit salad. Since I'm still (trying to) observe Pesach, I can only choose the latter option. And at this point, I'm starting to get sick of it.</p>

<p>Jeremy,I feel like I am reading a Lonely Planet guide book after<br />
reading and looking at your travel diary.  I hope you are having<br />
a good time and not spending toooo much time in creating this<br />
very professional web-site.  I don't think I have that much<br />
time in the day to take it all in but I am jealous, jealous that<br />
I am not young anymore.  The most adventurous thing we did over<br />
Pesach was watching the hot water system in the roof spring a<br />
leak and making the walls in the dining room look like they were<br />
crying!!!!  I wanted to claim it as a religious appiration and<br />
make loads of money from it, however all we did was call the<br />
plumber..  Stay well .  Suexxx</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with what they serve down there. And I'm usually the last person in the world to complain about boring breakfasts &mdash; hell, back home I've been eating Weet-Bix and milk every morning since 1823. But their free breakfast isn't that big; and fruit salad, tea, and juice is just not something that I personally would choose to eat day in, day out.</p>
<p>But hey, at least it's free!</p>
