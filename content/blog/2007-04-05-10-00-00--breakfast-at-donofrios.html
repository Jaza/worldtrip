<p>As part of our board at the <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a>, we get free breakfast each morning at the D'onofrio café, which is just downstairs. However, D'onofrio's "free menu" is rather limited: either toast and jam; toast and egg; or fruit salad. Since I'm still (trying to) observe Pesach, I can only choose the latter option. And at this point, I'm starting to get sick of it.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with what they serve down there. And I'm usually the last person in the world to complain about boring breakfasts &mdash; hell, back home I've been eating Weet-Bix and milk every morning since 1823. But their free breakfast isn't that big; and fruit salad, tea, and juice is just not something that I personally would choose to eat day in, day out.</p>
<p>But hey, at least it's free!</p>
