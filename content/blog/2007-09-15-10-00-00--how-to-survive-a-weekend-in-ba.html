<p>How to survive staying at a <a href="/blog/hostel-clan-ba">party hostel</a> in <abbr title="Buenos Aires">BA</abbr>, and going out all night long, all weekend long:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wake up and head upstairs to the hostel's bar, anytime between about 11pm and midnight. Get started on the drinks and the small talk.</li>
<li>Form a group, choose a club, and head out to said club anytime between about 2am and 3am (no earlier than this &mdash; the doors won't be open yet!).</li>
<li>Party in said club until anytime between 5am and 8am (optimally, leave between 6am and 7am).</li>
<li>Arrive back at your hostel, and sleep until about midday.</li>
<li>Hang around in the afternoon, maybe have a steak or two for lunch.</li>
<li>Go back to sleep at around 6pm or 7pm.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-6 until the weekend is through.</li>
