<p>I've heard of express international deliveries taking time, but this is getting beyond a joke. Seeing that I had nothing else to do today &mdash; apart from having to urgently leave Zürich (to see my friend <a href="/blog/killes">Gerhard</a> in Freiburg tonight) &mdash; today I spent most of the day sitting around in <a href="/blog/mark-and-susi">Mark and Susi</a>'s office, waiting for my bloody <abbr title="Automatic Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> card to arrive. I always thought that <a href="http://www.dhl.com/">DHL</a> were reasonably competent; but apparently, that is not the case. After calling and making repeated enquiries, it seems that the package arrived in Basel last night; that they had it in Zürich by this morning; that they then sent it <em>back to Basel</em> later in the morning; and that it didn't get back to Zürich (for a second time) until this afternoon. I finally gave up waiting for it, and grabbed the train up to Freiburg: but I'm going to have to come back for it tomorrow (which will be a right pain in the a$$); and I'm extremely frustrated that it's taking this long for the frikking thing to get here.</p>
