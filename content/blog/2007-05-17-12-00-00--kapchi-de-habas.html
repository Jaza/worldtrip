<p>Delicious, vegetarian dish of beans and potatoes, simmered in a spicy sauce of chili, egg, milk, and onion, and served with rice. This afternoon, for my final cooking lesson with <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>, our amazing chef Ricardo (of <a href="/blog/tiradito-de-pescado">tiradito de pescado</a> and <a href="/blog/causa-rellena">causa rellena</a> fame) showed us how to cook up some <em>kapchi de habas</em>, another spicy dish local to the Cusco area. A great final addition to my Andean cooking repertoire, and another one that I'll have to make again sometime!</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut the chilis in half, and take out and dispose of the seeds.</li>
<li>Boil the chilis until soft.</li>
<li>Fry the rice with a tspn of vegetable oil (and a pinch of salt) for a few minutes. Then add boiling water, and boil until cooked.</li>
<li>Peel and finely chop the onions, peel and shell the beans, and peel and finely chop the potatoes.</li>
<li>Drain the rice, and cook on low without water for a few mins.</li>
<li>Take the chilis off, and pull the skin off them (as with previous weeks, this isn't so easy &mdash; use your fingernails!). Then blend the chilis in a blender, with some oil.</li>
<li>Fry the onions with some oil. After a few mins, add the chili paste and stir. Then add the chopped potatoes and the <em>huacatay</em> stalks (the whole stalks, unchopped), and stir more.</li>
<li>Add lots of hot water (and some salt) to the frypan, and cover and simmer until the potatoes are soft and cooked.</li>
<li>Pull the cheese apart into little pieces.</li>
<li>After about 10 mins of simmering, add the beans to the frypan, and continue simmering.</li>
<li>Add the milk and the pieces of cheese to the frypan, and stir.</li>
<li>Take the frypan off, crack the eggs into the mix, and stir.</li>
<li>Serve the rice and the <em>kapchi</em> (i.e. the mix of everything else) on a plate, and garnish with <em>huacatay</em>.</li>
<li>Like they don't say in Peru: <em>dig in!</em> :P
