<p>I met this girl on the <a href="/blog/visa-run-to-burma">bus to Krabi</a> today. She's told me her name a zillion times: but I'm afraid it's all Dutch to me. She's been living in a small village near Ranong for the past 6 weeks, where she was volunteering as an English teacher at the local primary school. I hung out with her this evening in Krabi, and then we kept bumping into each other over the next few days, since we both continued on to Ton Sai. She's a bit daunted by all the <em>farangs</em>, after being in a remote Thai village for so long &mdash; but she's gradually getting used to seeing Westerners everywhere once again.</p>
