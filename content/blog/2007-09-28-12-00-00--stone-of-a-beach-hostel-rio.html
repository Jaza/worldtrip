<p><a href="http://www.stoneofabeach.com.br/">Stone of a Beach</a> is yet another one of those places where you go to party, not to sleep. Not that there's anything <em>wrong</em> with that :P. Situated in the heart of Copacabana, it's rivalled only by the infamous <a href="<br />
http://www.mellowyellow.com.br/">Mellow Yellow</a> as "the place to stay" in Rio. And with its sunny rooftop occupied by a well-stocked bar, a comfy TV room, and a sizzling hot <strong><em>jacuzzi</em></strong>, you couldn't ask for much more, as far as having fun at your hostel goes.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> crowded, messy, and noisy; but reasonably hygienic.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> "the party crowd". Lots of Aussies (here for the surf), plus all the usual European suspects.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> friendly, eager to join in the partying, and mostly English-speaking.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> middle of Copacabana, a few blocks from the beach. Convenient, in the action, and a reasonably safe area (by Rio standards).</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> nice buffet breakfast of cake, bread, <em>dulce de leche</em>, cereal, and fresh fruit. Sadly though, <a href="/blog/drinking-coffee-because-its-there">only coffee, no tea</a>. They also do BBQ dinners sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 3 reliable Linux terminals, available 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> quite good.</p>
