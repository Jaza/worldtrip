<p>Despite my best efforts, I simply can't remember what his real name is: anyway, we all call him "Finland", or "Finlandia". Finlandia is a giant of a dude (must be about 6"5'), with shoulder-length blonde hair, and an angular face that shows his Nordic heritage. He's a mountain guide (climbing, hiking, etc &mdash; he's fit enough to do it all), and he's been working in northern Chile for the past nine months. Thus, when we're not calling him Finlandia, his other name is "Chileno" (or just "<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=juebon">juebon</a>" :P). He's an extreme adventurer, as well as a great chef; and he's been an all-out partygoer during his time here at <a href="/blog/patanuk-hostel-bariloche">Patanuk</a>.</p>
