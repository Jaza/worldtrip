<p>Picked up this cheesy pair of chef's fashion accessories at the <a href="/blog/san-telmo-market">San Telmo market</a> this afternoon. The apron has a little boy-and-girl cartoon couple drawn on it. The hat has "Argentina" proudly embossed on its brim, and is about &frac12; a foot high when puffed up fully. This purchase may not make me a better cook; but at least I'll now look the part. Will be mandatory uniform, for next time I'm cooking the steaks at a Sunday BBQ. Now, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_(film)">who ordered medium-rare?</a> :P</p>
