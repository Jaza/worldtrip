<p>After I <a href="/blog/hasta-la-vista-suramerica">arrived in New York</a> this evening, and got through immigration, my first order of business was finding a hostel in which to spend the night. Considering that it was 12:30am by the time I got past the gates, I was kinda dreading this a bit. I hadn't made a reservation anywhere, as &mdash; unlike for the South American hostels &mdash; none of the hostels here in New York accept simple "online booking requests"; all that they accept online is a live advance credit-card payment, which I wasn't prepared to make. Anyway, I knew it wouldn't be fun searching for a bed at this hour on a Saturday night; but I never imagined that it would be this <em>hard!</em> I had the phone numbers of 6 different hostels: I called all of them; and of the places that I called, 3 didn't respond, and the other 3 were fully booked. Apparently it's Columbus Day long weekend here at the moment, and New York is packed with visitors. Just my luck, eh?</p>

<p>Since I'd exhausted all of my pre-prepared "hopeful options", with no success, I had few choices left. So I jumped in a shuttle bus at the airport, and said to the driver: "take me to a good, cheap hostel in Manhattan". Fortunately, the driver was a really nice guy, and he was also quite knowledgeable regarding where to stay in the city.</p>
<p>After he dropped all the other passengers off, he took me to the <a href="/blog/chelsea-international-hostel-new-york">Chelsea International</a>, a hostel in downtown Manhattan. We reached the place by about 2am &mdash; I ran into the reception desk, asked: "you got any beds for tonight?", and almost broke out in exultant song when the guy behind the counter said "yes". Praise the L-rd &mdash; hallelujah! I found somewhere to sleep! So I quickly ran back out to the shuttle bus, told the driver the good news, grabbed my bags, and checked in. I was out like a light, the moment I hit my bed. It's been a looong day.</p>
<p>OK, so I admit, it was a bit stupid of me to turn up in New York on a Saturday night, without a reservation anywhere. I'll try not to do it again. But anyhow, it all worked out fine in the end. :P</p>
