<p>I wasn't planning to do any sightseeing today &mdash; as the weather was lousy here in Rome, and as I had <a href="/blog/bicycle-window-shopping">other things that needed doing</a> &mdash; but on my way back from Porto Portese this afternoon, I ended up wandering by the Roman forum and senate. this is the north-western part of the "Palatino", the archaeological site in central Rome, that's actually the preserved remains of what was the main street of the ancient city. I never before realised that the absolute key, central area of ancient Rome is actually still here (albeit in crumbling form), and not all built-over, 2,000 years on. Quite a cool introduction to this most historic of all cities in the world.</p>
