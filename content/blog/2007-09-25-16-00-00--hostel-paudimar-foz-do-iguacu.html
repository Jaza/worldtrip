<p><a href="http://www.paudimar.com.br/">Paudimar</a> is the Brazilian sister to the <a href="/blog/hostel-inn-puerto-iguazu">Hostel Inn</a> on the Argentinean side. While it's not as big or as fancy as its famous sister, it's also part of the <a href="http://www.hihostels.com/">HI</a> network, and it's also a nice place to stay. They're a bit far out of town, but their spacious out-of-the-way location gives them room for an enormous garden, a set of hammocks, a nice swimming pool, and camping space. They also have a tour agency on-site, for all your booking needs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paudimar.com.br/">Paudimar</a> is the Brazilian sister to the <a href="/blog/hostel-inn-puerto-iguazu">Hostel Inn</a> on the Argentinean side.

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> fairly basic beds and dorms, but nice and quiet.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> as well as the usual hostel-to-hostel backpackers, they also attract a few of the more rugged and interesting types, since they have camping and trailer-home areas.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> helpful enough, and most of them speak English.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> a bit of a pain-in-the-a$$ spot, to tell the truth &mdash; 12km from town, and you need to catch 2 buses to get there. However, they are fairly close to both the waterfalls, and to the int'l airport.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> nice buffet breakfast, and the all-you-can-eat dinner is pretty good too.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> only 1 free PC &mdash; very hard to get on it! In fact, you generally need to <em>book</em> it on the whiteboard. They also have (total rip-off) by-the-minute PCs, and Wi-Fi for laptop owners.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> works well.</p>
