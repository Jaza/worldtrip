<p>Went on a little morning tour today &mdash; briefly leaving our oasis paradise of Huacachina &mdash; to some of Ica's famous wineries and pisco-making places, as well as to the city's much-adored chocolate factory. Can't really say we left paradise, because it was a pretty daym pleasant tour we had: it's a hard life when you have to spend all morning sampling gourmet chocolates, rich red wines, and perfectly-distilled piscos.</p>
<p>Myself, <a href="/blog/reunion-with-chris-from-mexico">Chris</a>, and a Norweigian couple got driven off in a private car &mdash; with our own driver &mdash; from <a href="/blog/casa-de-arena-huacachina">Casa de Arena</a> to start the tour. First stop was the "Helena" chocolate factory, where we saw the delicious cacao delights being made in the factory window, and where we had a chance to go into the very quaint old shop at the front, and where I <a href="/blog/helena-chocolates">made a purchase or two</a>. They have a cash register there that's over 100 years old!</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.borg.com/~superman/songs.html">Who can take a rainbow</a>, wrap it in a sigh, soak it in the sun and make a strawberry lemon pie? The candy man... the candy man can!</em></p>

<p><em>That cash register must be worth more than the money inside it.</em></p>
<p>Then we went to two different places where they make wine and <a href="/blog/pisco-sour">pisco</a>: one place that makes more of the dark red wine and the mixed-grape pisco, which is less traditional, but which sells better on the export market; and another place that specialises in traditional Ica wine (not so dark, more sweet), and in <em>pisco puro</em> (pure distilled pisco &mdash; pretty similar to vodka or to tequila). We got taken around, and shown various aspects of the distillation process for these alcoholic beverages &mdash; it's all fairly advanced here, since Ica makes the best (and, as far as I know, the only decent) wine and pisco in Peru.</p>

<p>Once we were done with all the obligatory tour-of-the-winery stuff, it was on to the real deal: wine and pisco tasting! Had some great samplings of fine dark red wines, sweet red wines, fruity white wines, lethal <em>pisco puros</em>, refreshing mixed-grape piscos, nice semi-prepared Pisco Sour mixes, and even a bit of creamy Bailey's-like pisco. Not bad, for one morning! As Chris said, at least it cured the hangover from the night before :P. I also decided to purchase one of the bottles of semi-prepared Pisco Sour &mdash; might send it back home as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Great tour, and very tasty beverages that we sampled. Also made our subsequent restaurant-quality hamburger lunch all the more palatable. Oh, what a hard day it's been!</p>
