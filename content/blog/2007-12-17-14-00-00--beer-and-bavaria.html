<p>During our <a href="/blog/ozzie-tour-of-munich">tour of Munich</a> today, Ozzie shared with us some interesting if alarming facts about beer and Bavaria. Bavaria is officially the beer capital of the world: not just by reputation, but also by the irrefutable weight of statistics. Have a look at some of these hair-raising facts, and you'll see what I mean.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are <strong>over 1,500 beers brewed in the State of Bavaria.</strong> That's more than in any other region (or country) in the world (it even slaughters <a href="/blog/kwak-and-i-forget-the-others">Belgium's 500+ beers</a> claim, which ain't small fry either).</li>
<li>The average German drinks 0.5L of beer each day. In contrast, <strong>the average Bavarian drinks 1.5L of beer each day.</strong>. They quite literally have beer for breakfast, lunch and tea (and corresponding preferred brews for these different times of the day).</li>
<li>In contrast with virtually everywhere else in the world, <strong>beer is legally classified as "food" in Bavaria.</strong> This makes it exempt from sales tax (under the "essential food products" exemption), and means that beer-drinking has a lower age limit than does other alcohol (in practice, of course, there's no age limit at all in Bavaria).</li>
<li><strong>You are legally entitled to drink up to 0.5L of beer when at work in Bavaria.</strong> As such, most employers keep their staff fridges well-stocked with beer: they figure that everyone's going to (and entitled to) drink anyway; so if they remove the need for their staff to go to the pub for a beer, then they'll lose less working hours each day.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bavaria also has numerous laws relating to the production of beer. In particular, according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a> ("Bavarian Purity Law") of 1516, all beer that's brewed in Bavaria is legally required to have <em>only</em> barley, hops and water (yeast was later added) as its ingredients (in accordance with centuries-old tradition). Most of these and other beer-related laws have been in place in Bavaria, and have remained virtually unchanged, for just as long a period. So not only is beer-drinking enormous in Bavaria: it's also a centuries-old tradition, a legally-sanctioned activity, and an inextricable part of the local culture (and even religion). If you want to spend every day for the rest of your life drinking a different amazing local beer, and still not exhaust the possibilities, then Bavaria is for you.</p>
