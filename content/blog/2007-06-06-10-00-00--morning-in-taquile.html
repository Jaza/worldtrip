<p>After last night's <a href="/blog/amantani-party-night">roaring party on Amantaní</a>, this morning <a href="/blog/boat-to-los-uros-and-amantani">we the crew</a> said our farewells to Amantaní and to <a href="/blog/amantani-family-stay">our one-night-stand families</a> there, and headed for the next island on the Peru side of Lake Titicaca: Taquile. On this famous island, we completed the arduous hike from lakeside to village, we relaxed in the sleepy town, and we checked out the local craftsmanship offerings.</p>
<p>Back on our boat, it was only a short ride of about &frac12; an hour from Amantaní to Taquile. Once we reached Taquile, we hopped off the boat, and commenced the island's infamous 500-stair hillside ascent, from the lake's shores to the island's town centre. I was feeling pretty damn energetic this morning, after the party and a solid sleep last night; so I powered up the stairs, ahead of everyone else, and enjoyed the fabulous views along the way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I reached the top of the island ahead of everyone else, I took a different path to my mates. I headed straight for the town centre; and once there, I sat down and waited for the others to catch up (assuming that they couldn't be that far behind). However, they'd taken another road, that went around the island on a fairly big detour, and that passed through a set of ruins, before curving back around to the town centre. So I was waiting quite a while for them; and when they finally arrived, I realised that I'd missed out on the ruins that they saw (although they assured me that I hadn't really missed much).</p>

<p>Apart from running up endless stairways like a madman, and getting lost, I also did some <a href="/blog/hats-from-taquile">hat shopping</a> in Taquile, and relaxed over some chocolate and a bottle of Inka Kola. Then, it was time for us to return to our boat, and to a long ride of 3&frac12; sleepy hours back to Puno, over the expansive blue waters of Lake Titicaca.</p>
