<p>The <a href="http://www.blackforest-hostel.de/">Black Forest Hostel</a> is a lovely big hostel, situated in a quiet street not-too-far from the centre of compact Freiburg, and (as its name suggests) just down the road from the start of the famous forest itself. The hostel was pretty quiet when I stayed there this evening; but it has a great common room &mdash; complete with couches, beanbags, TV, pool table, and fussball &mdash; which I'm sure would be great fun with more guests around. I didn't have time to hang around here for more than one night: but if my schedule had allowed it, there's no doubt that I would have chilled here for longer.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> the 18-bed dorms are massive, and have annoying creaky wooden floors, but are otherwise comfortable.
</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> I didn't see that many other guests while I was here (just because it's December, I assume), but those that I did see looked the friendly backpacker type.
</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> easy-going and helpful bunch &mdash; all fluent English-speakers as well.
</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> walking distance from the historic centre of Freiburg, and from the edge of the Black Forest; 10 minutes from the train station by tram.
</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> none provided, but the guest kitchen is well-equipped and spacious (and has a big fridge as well).
</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 1 PC, which is free for a 5-minute email check, and which is otherwise a reasonably pricey â‚¬2/hr. Staff are fairly relaxed about use of the machine.
</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> didn't get a chance to test it out.</p>
