<p>My bus this evening left Chiclayo at 10pm, and pulled in to the sandy shores of the beach resort town of Máncora at about 3am. Seems like this is about the best possible time to get in &mdash; it's that kind of a place. The entire town was pumping full-volume with discos, clubs, and bars. Drunk <em>gringos</em> and sleazy locals everywhere. Girls squealing, hips grinding, beers clinking. Pity that I was too buggered from my bus journey to get into it. I checked into a budget dorm at <a href="/blog/sol-y-mar-mancora">Sol y Mar</a> (yep, front desk open and kicking at this time), downed two shots of vodka, and crashed until the morning.</p>
