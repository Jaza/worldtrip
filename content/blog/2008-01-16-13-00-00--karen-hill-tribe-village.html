<p>For the second night of our <a href="/blog/doi-inthanon-trek-begins">Doi Inthanon trek</a>, we're staying at the Karen "hill-tribe" village in the area. I say "hill-tribe" with inverted commas, and for good reason: this is actually well-known as a "fake" village &mdash; unlike the real hill-tribe villages further north in Thailand, it's quite literally just kept here for the purposes of tourism &mdash; and this is fairly obvious when you visit the place. They get tourists staying here almost every night (especially during peak season), and they're neither awkward nor intimidated around us. We saw the hill-tribe school, where the local kids are taught to read and write; we were shown the villagers' humble houses; and we observed the various animals that roam freely around the town. Our accommodation for the night &mdash; like last night's &mdash; is a simply affair of bamboo huts, which are once again rather uncomfortable, but which are something rough and different.</p>
