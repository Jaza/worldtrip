<p><a href="/blog/taormina-town-of-tourists">Taormina wasn't for me</a>, so I came back down the hill, and hung out in Giardini Naxos. Upon my return to Giardini, I was relieved to find that it's a much more relaxed, much more reasonably-priced town than its neighbour up top. I called it an early half-day today, and the afternoon here in Giardini was very easy-going: I checked into a budget B&amp;B (the cheapest one I've found so far); I enjoyed the day's hot choc break; I found some Internet, and went online for a few hours (after waiting for the Sicilian siesta to end &mdash; it finished "early" here, at 3pm); and I grabbed some <em>tavola calda</em> (sort-of "fast food") for dinner. Life's easy in Giardini &mdash; I don't wanna leave Sicily. Why can't I stay here forever?</p>
