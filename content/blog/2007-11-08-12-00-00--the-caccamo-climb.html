<p>Call me a silly cyclist if you will, but it seems that I just can't get enough of these Sicilian mountains: after a (rather aggravating) <a href="/blog/termini-imerese-the-evil-city">morning coastal ride</a>, today I'm headed inland again, into the mountains. From Términi Imerese, I rode south up a gruelling mountain road, until I reached the town of Caccamo. This is a quaint little place, which is most famous for its imposing Norman castle, of at least 1,000 years' antiquity. It was a hard slog: but I had a good rest and a big drink when I reached Caccamo; and the castle (although I didn't explore it) is worth at least passing by.</p>

<p><em>Caccamo: town and castle.</em></p>
<p>Since I rocked up at Caccamo around 2pm, it was all very quiet in the town; so I just sat down in the little park on the main drag, and relaxed over a big drink of water, and munched on my lunch. One thing's for sure, down here in Sicily: come afternoon time, the locals take the whole <em>siesta</em> thing very seriously indeed &mdash; especially in the smaller towns. If you think <em>anything</em> is going to be open between about 2pm and 4pm (or even between 1pm and 5pm), then think again. Seriously: it makes South America look like a hard-working, all-day kind of place &mdash; which it isn't either, let me tell you. Takes a bit of getting used to: but once you start to understand their strange opening times (or lack thereof), it is kinda possible to work around it.</p>
