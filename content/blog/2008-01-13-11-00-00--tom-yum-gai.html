<p><a href="http://www.templeofthai.com/recipes/tom_yum_gai.php">Tom Yum Gai</a> is a delicious hot and spicy chicken soup, and is one of the classic dishes of Thailand. "Tom Yum" ("hot soup") consists of a watery broth, as opposed to "Tom Kha" ("coconut soup") whose liquidy substance consists mainly of coconut milk. Either can be prepared with "Gai" ("chicken"), or with various other meats / seafoods, such as "Goong" ("shrimp" / "prawns"). The dish is amazingly quick and easy to prepare, and it tastes divine &mdash; especially when you add <em>lots</em> of chili! This was the first dish that I cooked during <a href="/blog/cooking-in-chiang-mai">today's cooking class</a>.</p>
