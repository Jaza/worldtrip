<p>I met Noam when I checked in at Nomadas this morning. He's a laid-back, good Jewish boy (like myself) from Boston: he's from the same neighbourhood as my cousins, but he doesn't know them. He's been in Mexico for 2 months, and now he wants to go to the UK, and do a masters in anthropology at Oxford.</p>

<p>I hung out a bit with Noam today: we chatted in the morning; and then later, we went on a bus tour together. He seemed to be in a very blasé kind of mood: I think he's kinda over his trip, and he's just waiting to go back home.</p>
