<p>Fairly basic little guest-house, close to the centre of town in Chiclayo. This place used to be called "Hostal Lido" &mdash; that's what it's listed as <a href="/blog/lonely-planet-you-disappoint-me">in my out-of-date LP</a> &mdash; but it recently changed both its name and its owners. It bills itself as a "backpacker's hostel", but it's not a hostel (no dorms, only single / double private rooms &mdash; don't think they have any real hostels in Chiclayo), and it doesn't have any communal hang-out area for backpackers. Anyway, I think that for cheap and convenient accommodation, it's about the best that Chiclayo has to offer. The lady-in-charge these days is very friendly, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> not big on ye 'ol d√©cor, but nice enough.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> a big hard to meet the fellow guests, but the ones that I ran into were very nice.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> friendly, very chatty.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> just a few blocks from Chiclayo's <em>Plaza de Armas</em> &mdash; walking distance from the bus terminals, as well. Plenty of eating and shopping outside your door.</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> none. But there are two great salad / yoghurt / ice-cream places, next-door on either side of the hostel.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> a bit electrifying (as is traditional in Peru), but otherwise good.</p>
