<p>Rio de Janeiro. City of surf, sand, and sensuality. The sun always shines in Rio, right? <em>Right?!</em> This evening, when <a href="/blog/long-way-to-rio">my bus</a> pulled into the city of Rio, I arrived to find that it was pouring with rain. What's going on &mdash; how can there be bad weather in Rio?! The world's gone mad, I say. Anyway, everyone's saying it'll clear up soon &mdash; and it better. <em>"When my baby, when my baby spits on me it rains in Rio, de Janeiro, and the thunder bellows..." :P.</em></p>
