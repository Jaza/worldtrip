<p>Beatrice ("Bea") is a beautiful blonde Italian girl, whom I met this evening at <a href="/blog/central-station-guesthouse-pisa">the guesthouse</a>. Although only 21 years old (like myself), she's already been working three years full-time as a flight attendant (that being the <abbr title="Politically Correct">PC</abbr>-<abbr title="Gender Neutral">GN</abbr> term for "air hostess") for <a href="http://www.ryanair.com/">RyanAir</a>, Europe's favourite budget airline. She's moved from her home in northern Italy over to Dublin, Ireland; and she's just in Pisa for one night, exhausted and in between flights. She was too buggered for me to take her out anywhere tonight; but she did help me polish off the home-made pasta napolitana that I cooked up for dinner.</p>
