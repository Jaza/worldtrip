<p><a href="/blog/wil-from-amigos">Wil</a> and Monica, two of the students that have been with me at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a> these past two weeks, are leaving Cusco tomorrow. As such, tonight we held a little farewell get-together for them, over at <a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a>'s house. We had a good turnout for the farewell &mdash; of students, staff, and friends of the school &mdash; and it was a fun night of talking, reminiscing, and beveraging. Wil and Monica have both been great friends to me during their time here, and I know I'm not the only one that's going to miss them.</p>

<p>As is the custom for almost any visit to Jesus's house, there was a mandatory drinking of vodka and orange for everyone. Not sure why Jesus is so big on the vodka and orange: when a bunch of people are sitting on couches in a cosy living room, and they drink a lot of vodka, all that happens is that everyone falls asleep. Not that exciting, really. Anyway, a few of the others continued on to the nightclubs in the Plaza de Armas: however, I'd had enough to drink, and I had classes at 8am the next day, so I called it a night before the clubbing began.</p>
