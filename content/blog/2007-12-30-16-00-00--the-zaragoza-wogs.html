<p>The Zaragoza wogs are a funny group of three, all of whom are here in Madrid, and staying in my room at <a href="/blog/cats-hostel-madrid">Cat's</a>: a German guy; his Ukrainian girlfriend; and the girlfriend's friend, another girl from Latvia. The two girls have been living in Zaragoza for several months, where they're studying on exchange; the boyfriend is just here on vacation for the New Year. The three of them have a complicated language arrangement: the couple prefer to talk to each other in German; the two girls converse privately in Russian (or in their half-decent Spanish); and all three can understand each other in English. This evening, I went out with the wogs for a late kebab dinner, where they serve excellent <em>baklava.</em></p>
