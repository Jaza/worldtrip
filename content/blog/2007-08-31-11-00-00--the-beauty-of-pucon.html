<p>After my random friend <a href="/blog/chisco">Chisco</a>, and his stoned mates, stumbled home to their beds for the afternoon, I enjoyed a nice relaxing afternoon of reading in the town's lakeside park. Couldn't be bothered to do much else today, as I was fairly buggered after yesterday's climb up the volcano. The lakeside in Pucón is the perfect place to chill and unwind for an afternoon: what with the divine weather, the chirping of the birds, and the still blue waters, there's definitely <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle"><em>so much serenity</em></a> there, it's just not funny. Haven't stopped and inhaled the palpable beauty of a place this much, since my stop at <a href="/blog/finding-inner-peace-at-palenque">a very beautiful place in Mexico</a>, once upon a time.</p>

<p>Tonight was also my last night here in Pucón: and like the day, it was relaxing and enjoyable. I wasn't planning to go out for dinner tonight &mdash; since it's so expensive here in Pucón (even by Chilean standards), that I've mainly been subsisting on cooking up food from the local supermarket. But I thought <em>what the hell, it's my last night in Chile</em>: so I went out with two guys from <a href="/blog/hostal-el-refugio-pucon">the hostel</a> &mdash; an Aussie guy called John, and his friend from Switzerland &mdash; for a scrumptious dinner of gourmet pasta, served with and followed by a few beers. I gotta say, El Refugio may be a tiny place to stay, but it seems to always be full of great and friendly people.</p>
<p>I think that Pucón has a bit more night life to offer (perhaps a disco or two?), but I didn't check it out tonight. It's quite a small place, so I doubt that they have that much. And anyway, I'll be in Bariloche next week, so I hardly think that night life is something I really need to worry about at the moment!</p>
