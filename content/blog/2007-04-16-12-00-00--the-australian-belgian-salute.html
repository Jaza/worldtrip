<p>In Australia, we have a tradition that when you reach the highest point in a hike through mountains, you acknowledge the occasion with a (shall we say) "special" kind of salute. Being the true blue Aussie that I am, I was obliged to salute my fellows atop Paso Salkantay, at 4,600m <abbr title="above sea level">asl</abbr>. But what I <em>didn't</em> expect was for the boys of <a href="/blog/the-belgian-front">the Belgian Front</a> to join me in performing the salute. Great sports, those Belgians. And apparently quite capable of being as big a bunch of bogans as us Aussies.</p>
