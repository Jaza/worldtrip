<p>Took about 45 mins to get to Los Uros; and once we were finished there, it was about 3 hours to Amantaní. Not exactly a short trip &mdash; but hey, it was worth it. The boat itself was also fairly fast and reliable, even if not quite 5-star. We had a really weird deal with the drivers (not sure which of the two was the captain): one of them was constantly really happy and giving us broad smiles; and the other one was grim and sour-faced the entire time. Lake Titicaca's very own odd couple.</p>
