<p>Garth is a colleague of my <a href="/blog/uncle-paul">Uncle Paul</a>, who's just started doing a Master's in Economic and Social History at Oxford. Paul was kind enough to let Garth know about me, and Garth was kind enough to take me on a tour around Oxford university today. Garth's a great guy, and he has a lot of ambition &mdash; I guess that makes Oxford the perfect place for him to be.</p>
