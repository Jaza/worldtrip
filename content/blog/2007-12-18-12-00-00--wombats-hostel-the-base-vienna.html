<p>It almost seems like I haven't left Munich at all: because here I am in Vienna, and I've just moved from <a href="/blog/wombats-hostel-munich">one Wombat's</a> to <a href="http://www.wombats-hostels.com/vienna/">another</a>! The Wombat's chain in strongest here in Vienna: they have two separate hostels in the city (both near the main train station); and I stayed in the bigger and older one, "the base". Wombat's (the base) isn't quite as crazy a party venue as is Wombat's Munich, but it still has a great bar (with a free welcome drink upon arrival), nice facilities, and tonnes of Aussie guests.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> much like the Munich branch &mdash; clean, secure, quiet.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> more of a mixed bag here &mdash; but still a great backpacker crowd, and still a strong contingent of Aussies.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> friendly and helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> short walk from Vienna's Westbahnhof station. City centre can be reached by a quick and cheap metro ride.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> same deal as Munich, €4 buffet breakfast that I managed to scam for €0.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> once again, same as Munich &mdash; €2 in the hostel, €1 at the numerous dodgy cafés down the road.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> terrific (and like Wombat's Munich, each dorm has its own ensuite bathroom).</p>
