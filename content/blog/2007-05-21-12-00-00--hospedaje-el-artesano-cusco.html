<p>Quiet, clean, cheap, and central yet out-of-the-way little hostel-slash-guesthouse, situated in Cusco's trendy and eclectic San Blas neighbourhood. I checked in to this place (on the recommendation of <a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a>) after <a href="/blog/farewell-to-my-cusco-family">leaving my host family</a> today, and I'll be here on-and-off for the rest of my time in Cusco. It seems to be almost empty &mdash; I've got a 6-bed dorm all to myself &mdash; and this is probably due to its being very basic, and to its location at the top of a big hill, which can only be climbed on foot via a flight of steep steps.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> clean and quiet, and bathrooms in each room.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> not very many &mdash; mainly older people, and a few families.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> friendly, and mostly part of the same family (bit of a family business going on) &mdash; but no English.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> fairly central, and a 10-minute walk from the Plaza, but it's a hike up a big hill.</p>
<p><strong>Food / Internet:</strong> none (but they have a kitchen).</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> excellent! Great showers to be had (just check that the switch for the water heating device is on &mdash; this got me once).</p>
