<p>Spent all day today down at the <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=754">Sunnyvale Sheraton</a>, where the Drupal folks managed to hire out a big room, and to fill it with an abundance of Wi-fi, coffee, and donuts. So that we could conduct the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/node/33">Drupal Hackfest</a>. The day was a great success, with close to 100 developers churning away code throughout the room, and working through the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal">core issue queue</a>, and with three core committers present to help get those patches in once and for all, by making <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cvs/3060">core CVS commits</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Refreshments were of a high standard all day, with free coffee and Krispy Kreme donuts available in the morning, and with great bulk-ordered California burritos for lunch. Nobody went hungry or thirsty, so we were all able to comfortably keep hacking all day long.
</p>
<p>Biggest commit of the day was <a href="http://jeff.viapositiva.net/">Eaton</a>'s patch to replace all the various <code>hook_xyz_alter()</code> invocations in core with a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/110888">new, generic drupal_alter() function</a>. Got committed about 5pm, by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/1">Dries</a>, with help from many other people (including a review and +1 from myself).
