<p>I've <a href="/blog/loki-hostel-cusco">done Cusco</a>. I've <a href="/blog/loki-hostel-la-paz">done La Paz</a>. Now, I've got the complete set of three: I've done Loki Lima! As with its two brethren, Loki Lima is the place to be: smack bang in the middle of Miraflores (across the road from the massive McDonald's), with a kicking Irish bar on the premises, and with super-friendly guests and staff. Very different to <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a>, which is nice, but a lot more tranquil. When you come to Loki, you come to enjoy, not to sleep.</p>

As with its two brethren, Loki Lima is the place to be: smack bang in the middle of Miraflores (across the road from the massive McDonald's), with a kicking Irish bar on the premises, and with super-friendly guests and staff. Very different to <a href="/blog/flying-dog-hostel-lima">Flying Dog</a>, which is nice, but a lot more tranquil. When you come to Loki, you come to enjoy, not to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> very nice, all re-furbished, and quite modern and warm.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> always friendly, always in abundance, but seldom sober. That's Loki for you.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> helpful, 100% English-speaking, and also seldom sober.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> middle of Miraflores &mdash; across from the big roundabout, and from Parque Kennedy &mdash; near everywhere you could possibly eat, shop, and be merry. Quite far from central Lima, though.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> usual Loki deal, of free breakfast of bread / jam / tea / coffee; plus anything else at any time of the day, at an extra charge.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 2 free PCs, both fast and reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> Sure is.</p>
