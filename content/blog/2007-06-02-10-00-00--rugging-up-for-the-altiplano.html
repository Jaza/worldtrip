<p>Cusco was cold when I got here (almost 8 weeks ago!), and it's been getting progressively colder ever since; but everyone warns me that my next destinations, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puno">Puno</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Paz">La Paz</a>, are even colder. In preparation for this, I visited <a href="/blog/el-molino">El Molino</a> this afternoon, and bought myself a new jacket. Warm, waterproof, and reasonably stylish: and all for just s/40!</p>
