<p>I needed to get the bus back from Bath to London this morning &mdash; but I hadn't booked a ticket; and I had no idea what the departure times were (I tried checking yesterday, but the terminal was closed). As it turned out, I was really, really lucky: I checked out of <a href="/blog/st-christophers-inn-bath">St. Christopher's</a>, rocked up at the bus terminal at 9:40am, and just managed to jump on the 9:45am express bus to London! Phew &mdash; would have been quite a wait if I'd missed it. See, turns out that you don't have to plan and book-ahead <em>everything</em> here in Europe: sometimes you can get away with doing it the Latin way &mdash; i.e. turn up, and go somewhere, just like that.</p>
