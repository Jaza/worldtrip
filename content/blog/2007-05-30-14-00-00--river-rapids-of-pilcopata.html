<p>Once we were done with <a href="/blog/pilcopata-the-jungle-tour">the morning's jungle tour</a> and lunch, this afternoon we returned from our trek, to <a href="/blog/animals-on-the-farm-in-pilcopata">the farm near Pilcopata</a>, via river raft. The rapids were supposedly "class II"; but compared to my <a href="/apurimac-rafting-trip-the-finale">three-day Apurímac rafting trip</a> last week, they were a class-zero romantic pleasure-ride. Barely a splash the whole way along &mdash; little more than a light current to keep us going, really. But a good bit of fun, nonetheless.</p>
<p>It seriously was a bit of a joke, calling this afternoon's boat trip "river rafting". The rapids were so light, they didn't even bother to give us wet-suits, helmets, or paddles (that's right, we just sat there &mdash; only the guides had paddles!) &mdash; just life-jackets, and in we hopped. We got a tiny bit of water splashing into the raft, now and then, but barely any. We also put our stuff into (one little poorly sealed) dry-bag; but that was hardly necessary either.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a pleasant ride back to the farm, and the scenery along the way was great as well. Winding river, muddy shores, and misty, lush, cloud-covered forest all around. Also good for the others, most of whom had no rafting experience, and who just wanted to relax and have a nice little float down the river.</p>
