<p>On the way to Teotihuacan, we stopped at a little tourist house, and tried some shots of home-made tequila and mezcal. These drinks aren't nearly as strong as the usual variations that you find in bars, but they taste much better!
</p>
<p>These drinks are mixed with almonds and honey, among other things. The result is sensational.</p>
