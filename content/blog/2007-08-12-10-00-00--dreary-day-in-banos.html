<p>And seriously, what is with the crappy weather up here in Ecuador? In all my four months of travelling through Peru, Bolivia, and northern Chile, I maybe saw two days of rain. Down there, "dry season" really means "dry season". It might be cold up in those mountains; but the sun she does shine, every day, guaranteed. In Ecuador, it's a different story: it is <em>apparently</em> the dry season here as well; but that merely means "only raining every second day". I think that due to its straddling the equator, Equator doesn't have the clear seasonal distinctions of its southern neighbours: it's just wet all year round. I'd hate to imagine what it's like here from Dec-Jan. Anyway, all this rain is really starting to annoy me. I wish it would clear up for a change.</p>
