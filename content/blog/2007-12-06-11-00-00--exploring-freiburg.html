<p>Before buggering off out of the place, this morning I took a little stroll around the charming city of Freiburg &mdash; the first place I've ever visited in Germany &mdash; and explored its historic centre. My buddy <a href="/blog/killes">Killes</a> had already shown me a fair bit of the town last night: but it was too dark and rainy last night to see anything properly; so today, I re-discovered it again in better conditions. I stuck mainly to the area of the cathedral and the daily morning market (home to plenty of different foods), as well as the central shopping area. Sadly, all I had was about an hour to complete the tour, before I needed to leave: a bit rushed, but better than nothing.</p>
