<p>Before I get on to the topic of leaving Baños, I'd just like to mention that I've had a great breakfast (about 3 times now in Baños &mdash; including this morning) at a place called <em>Rico Pan</em>. In my opinion, it's the best breakfast joint in town. As the name suggests, their bread is indeed very tasty (and very fresh &mdash; go early, and it's still hot out of their ovens!). Their meals are good value: for a good price, they'll give you a combo of bread, spread, hot chocolate, fresh fruit juice, and either fried eggs or a muesli / fruit salad mix. They also have excellent service &mdash; fast, efficient, and not forgetful &mdash; something that's extremely hard to come by, in this part of the world. Look out for them, just by the central park in Baños.</p>
<p>So, after my <em>desayuno rico</em> (lit: "tasty breakfast") this morning, I hopped on a bus to Tena. Took about 5 hours (as the <a href="/blog/lonely-planet-you-disappoint-me">good book</a> says), and was rainy and bumpy most of the way. No major incidents, except that we got held up for a little while at one point, where they were doing roadworks, and were only letting a few vehicles through every few minutes. It had cleared up by the time I reached Tena. It had also warmed up a lot! Baños may have been a somewhat chilly mountain town; but Tena is most definitely a hot, humid, and laid-back jungle town.</p>
<p>Now that I've made it, all that remains is for me to check out the rafting situation, so that I can have a few days of fun on the rivers around here.</p>
