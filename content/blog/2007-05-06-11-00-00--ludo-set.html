<p>I saw a stall full of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_(board_game)">ludo</a> sets at the <a href="/blog/pisac-market-morning">Pisac markets this morning</a>; and being the avid ludo fan that I am, I couldn't resist purchasing one. It's a beautifully designed little wooden set, with a decorated board and animal-sculpted pieces. Unfortunately, one of the llama heads has already snapped off &mdash; but a bit of superglue should be able to fix that. The board has already been christened with two games &mdash; of myself against <a href="/blog/jesus-from-amigos">Jesus</a> &mdash; and so far the score is 1-all.</p>
