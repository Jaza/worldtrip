<p>This morning I paired up with my mate <a href="/blog/thierry-and-wilson">Thierry</a>, and together we embarked upon a chilly but pleasant exploration of downtown Salzburg. Our ultimate aim was to reach the hilltop <a href="/blog/hohensalzburg-fortress-tour">Hohensalzburg fortress</a>; but we had no hurry, so we managed to take in a fair few of Salzburg's attractions along the way. Salzburg is a gorgeous town, perfectly preserved over more than 500 years, and ridiculously compact and convenient to wander around in. The weather was freezing (quite literally &mdash; town signboards read -2&deg;C) &mdash; but at least it was reasonably sunny. And anyway: it was my first-ever exposure to a frost- and snow-covered cityscape, and I for one was revelling in its beauty.</p>

<p><em>Salzburg's historic central cemetery, where generations of local families are buried together in the room-sized tombs (to this day), and where the snow-covered graves look charming at this time of year.</em></p>
