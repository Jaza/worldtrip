<p>This morning, being <a href="/blog/santa-cruz-here-we-come">all prepared and geared up</a> from yesterday afternoon, I left the town of Huaraz, and my 5-day Santa Cruz-Llanganuco hike began.

<p>This morning, being <a href="/blog/santa-cruz-here-we-come">all prepared and geared up</a> from yesterday afternoon, I left the town of Huaraz, and my 5-day Santa Cruz-Llanganuco hike began. Didn't get quite as much sleep last night as I'd hoped for &mdash; as it took a while to pack my bags in the evening, and to sort out everything that I don't need for the hike and can leave in Huaraz &mdash; so I wasn't up until about 6:30am, and I wasn't on the <em>combi</em> out of Huaraz until 7am (all about an hour behind schedule). But it turned out that this wasn't too late at all: day 1 of the hike went fine, and I finished the first day's route with time to spare.
</p>
<p>After checking out of <a href="/blog/jos-place-huaraz">Jo's Place</a> this morning &mdash; and dumping all my crap in their storage room &mdash; I jumped on a <em>combi</em> (with my massive backpack tied onto the roof), and headed north, through the valley between the Cordilleras <em>Blanca</em> and <em>Negra</em>, to the town of Caraz. Took about 2 hours to get to Caraz, with plenty of random locals hopping on and off along the way. <em>Combi</em> rides are never the most comfortable affairs &mdash; not with 25+ people crammed into a minibus made for 15 &mdash; but the Peruvians are a small race, and nobody can deny that it's guaranteed to be a fun ride. And a cheap one, too.
</p>
<p>Got to Caraz at about 9am, and then hopped on a <em>moto</em> for the first time (a motorbike with a seat and canvas attached to the back of it &mdash; could barely fit both myself and my backpack inside it, and it could barely get up the modest hills of downtown Caraz), just to give me a lift between the <em>combi</em> stop, and the place where shared taxis leave for Cashapampa. It's about another hour to Cashapampa, and that's the spot where the hike begins. Wasn't a problem getting a shared taxi: so a few <em>soles</em> and a very bumpy road later (the road from Huaraz to Caraz is paved, but it's dirt through the hills, from Caraz to Cashapampa), I made it to the starting point.
