<p>It was a fun Friday night of alcohol, dancing, and loud music. Everyone already proved that they can slog it out in the mountains of the Andes; and tonight, everyone proved that they can also get it on, on the dance floor. I don't remember how late we stayed out tonight, but I think it was pretty late.</p>
