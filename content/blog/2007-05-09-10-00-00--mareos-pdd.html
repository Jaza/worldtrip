<p><em>Mareos</em> literally means "dizziness". When you run around in circles, you might say afterwards: <em>"tengo mareos"</em> (<em>"I feel dizzy"</em>). But this word also has other interesting meanings. If someone's so drunk that they can't walk in a straight line, you could say: <em>"es mareado"</em> (<em>"he's tipsy"</em>). And here in the Andean highlands, <em>mareos</em> often has a special, specific meaning. It's very common for people to have altitude sickness in the mountains, and the common symptoms of dizziness and light-headedness are referred to as <em>mareos</em>.</p>
