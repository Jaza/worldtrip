<p>There may not be many other reasons to visit Catania: but this alone should make the city a "must" for anyone in the area. While <a href="/blog/catania-tour">passing through Catania</a> this morning, I stopped at a very upmarket cafe on the city's seashore promenade, that proudly advertises letting you choose from <em>32 different types of chocolate</em>, to be used in making you a hot choc. I was sold in two seconds flat. I walked in, closed my eyes, picked a number, and ordered no. 17. I really doubt that it would have mattered which number I'd chosen, though: I'd say they were all just as divine as each other. I also ordered a truly decadent, cream-filled cannoli pastry &mdash; all this was about double the price of the average morning coffee stop; but hey, sometimes you just gotta live life, and love life.</p>
