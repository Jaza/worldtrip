<p>The Xalapa to Veracruz route is fairly short (about 2 hours), and there are buses servicing it very frequently. When I got the bus, at 2pm, they were running <em>every 15 minutes</em>. Not bad.</p>
<p>There was a lady sitting next to me on the bus, who was trying to explain her occupation to me. Of course, I couldn't understand what she was saying. Eventually, I gave up and handed her my pocket Spanish dictionary, indicating that she should use it to explain her job better. She pointed me to a word called <em>carretera</em>, which means "roads" or "highways". So I guess she works for the Department of Transport, or some equivalent thereof.</p>
