<p>After finishing up at the <a href="/blog/bruning-museum-in-lambayeque">Brüning Museum</a>, <a href="/blog/kate-the-healer">Kate</a> and I continued on to the ruins of Túcume, which are also close to Chiclayo, about &frac12; an hour further up the road from Lambayeque (as the <em>combi</em> goes). Interesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche">Moche</a> ruins, although they really are the most ruined ruins I've seen so far in Peru: they're supposed to be pyramids, but really, they just look like big mounds of dirt. Anyway, it's a nice walk to them, from the town of Túcume; and the scenery from the lookout is very pleasant there.</p>
