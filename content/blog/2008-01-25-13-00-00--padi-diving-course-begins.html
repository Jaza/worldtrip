<p>This afternoon, I commenced the first session of my <abbr title="Professional Assocation of Diving Instructors">PADI</abbr> Open Water diving course. We're a big group: 16 people in all (although 1 person dropped out the following day) &mdash; but we're being split into two groups for the actual diving. This afternoon, the course's introduction consisted largely of boring but essential theory information: we had a short lecture from <a href="/blog/flav-the-diver">Flav</a>, and then we sat and watched parts I-III of the PADI instructional video series. Not the <em>most</em> boring educational videos I've ever been subjected to in my time: but then again, not far off it. One thing I couldn't help but observe: never before in my life have I been in a classroom with such an amazing view :P.</p>
