<p>Stephan's a law graduate from Quebec, Canada, who's come down to Cusco to do some voluntary legal work with <a href="http://hampy.org/">Hampy</a> for a few months. As well as being a friendly guy, he's also an interesting conversationalist, and a keen and adventurous hiker. He has, on occasion, been known to drink more than he can handle, and to suffer the consequences. But generally speaking, he's pretty reliable and responsible.</p>
