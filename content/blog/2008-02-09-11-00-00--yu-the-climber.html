<p>Yu's an interesting guy: his heritage is 100% Thai, but he's been living in Canada for the past few years, and he's planning to go back there, in the hope of obtaining residency. As such, he speaks much better English than most do most Thais (it's quite rare for Thai locals to have travelled internationally). As my buddy <a href="/blog/jet-li">Let</a> was away today, and as Yu just arrived back in Ton Sai (and in Thailand!) this morning, he was my instructor for the <a href="/blog/rock-climb-finale-multipitching">final stint</a> of my climbing course today. He's strict and extremely thorough, but he's a great guy and an excellent climber.</p>
