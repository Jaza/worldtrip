<p>Dave's an Aussie guy in his 30s, who's lived for most of his life on Kangaroo Island (off the coast of South Australia), and who works in tourism marketing (was working for SA tourism &mdash; so yes, you can blame him for those crappy "visit South Australia" ads). He's down here in South America for a few weeks, before heading off to London, where he's hoping to spend some time doing what every other Aussie does, and working there. I met him on the <a href="/blog/bus-day-via-osorno">bus to Bariloche</a> today, and he hung out with me at <a href="/blog/patanuk-hostel-bariloche">Patanuk</a> for a few days, before continuing south.</p>
