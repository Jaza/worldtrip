<p>I've been eating plenty of kebabs here in Europe, and I've been doing so with generally good results. They're cheap, they're filling, <a href="/blog/on-immigrants-in-europe">they're everywhere</a>, and most of the time they leave you feeling fine. But today, I pushed my luck too far: the kebab platter that I had for lunch clearly contained some questionable meat; because for the rest of the afternoon, I was either asleep in bed or sitting on the toilet. Seems that I've had one kebab too many. Gotta keep a discerning eye on those incredibly dodgy-looking spit-roasts that they use.</p>
