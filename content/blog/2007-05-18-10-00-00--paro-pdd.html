<p>A <em>paro</em> is a "strike" or a "demonstration". Generally, disgruntled workers hold a <em>paro</em>. It usually involved the stoppage of services (such as public transport), rioting, and sometimes violence. Since I'm going to Bolivia soon, I'll no doubt be witnessing quite a few <em>paros</em> there (as they're basically a way of life in Bolivia). In fact, there's a big <em>paro</em> going on there right now &mdash; I hope it's finished by the time I arrive there. <em>Paro</em> can also mean "unemployed": a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dole+bludger">dole bludger</a> could say <em>"estoy en paro"</em> (lit: <em>"I'm unemployed"</em>). Also elderly people and smokers (in particular) are sometimes known to have a <em>"paro cardiaco"</em> (lit: <em>"cardiac arrest"</em>, or <em>"heart attack"</em>).</p>

<p>Well, this is the 10<sup>th</sup> and final <abbr title="Palabra Del DÃ­a">PDD</abbr> for my time here in Cusco. It's been good doing these PDDs the past two weeks, but I'm pretty much over them by now. Anyway, let's be honest: they were basically a way of filling in blog space during the remainder of my quiet-not-on-the-road time here at <a href="/blog/amigos-spanish-school">Amigos</a>; and now that I'm finished with school, I won't be learning as many <em>"palabras nuevas"</em> ("new words"). But I hope that all you readers have enjoyed them.</p>
