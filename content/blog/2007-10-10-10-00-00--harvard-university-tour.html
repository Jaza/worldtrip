<p>Some of the sights that we saw on the tour:</p>

<p><em>The ugly science building of Harvard (hey, at least their ugliest building isn't their centrepiece, like it is <a href="http://www.uts.edu.au/">at some people's universities</a>!).</em></p>

<p><em>Our colourful tourguide; and John Harvard, founder of Harvard in 1638, in the background. Our guide explained that this is called "the statue of three lies", because: (1) it's not John Harvard (nobody knew what he looked like, when they made the statue); (2) John Harvard didn't found the university, he merely donated the land that it was built on; and (3) he didn't donate it in 1638, it was earlier. Apparently, this is also the third most-photographed statue in the USA, after the Statue of Liberty in New York, and Lincoln's statue at the memorial in Washington.</em></p>
<p>Cool little tour, and a nice cosy group of 5 people. Harvard sure is a grand place. And to think that my Aunt Janine studied and worked here for over 20 years! I'd be happy if I ever ended up simply cleaning out the loos here &mdash; but you'd need at least a Master's, before they're even consider giving you a job like that :P.</p>
