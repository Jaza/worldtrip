<p>One of Boston's most famous attractions (for tourists and academics alike) is <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>, one of the most famous, prestigious, and expensive universities in the world. Harvard is easily the top (as well as the oldest) university in the USA, and it's probably rivalled only by <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford</a> itself in terms of reputation. Harvard is also the second-richest non-profit, non-government institution in the world, surpassed only by the Roman Catholic Church. Today, my <a href="/blog/dad">dad</a> and I went on "the unofficial tour of Harvard", one of the guided tours that you can do of the university's main campus.

<p>Cool little tour, and a nice cosy group of 5 people. Harvard sure is a grand place. And to think that my Aunt Janine studied and worked here for over 20 years! I'd be happy if I ever ended up simply cleaning out the loos here &mdash; but you'd need at least a Master's, before they're even consider giving you a job like that :P.</p>
