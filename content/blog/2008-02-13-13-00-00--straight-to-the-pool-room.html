<p>When asked why you'd want to go to Thailand (instead of to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/goulburnmurray/stories/s1558796.htm">Bonnie Doon</a>), <a href="http://www.spybroken.com/bana/film/castle.php">Con</a> replied: "it's the culture, Mr. Kerrigan." And he's right: Thailand does have an amazing culture. And that's exactly why I had to purchase a few souvenirs of that culture, to bring back to my loudly and proudly uncultured homeland. An absolutely essential purchase was the elephant &mdash; so essential was it, in fact, that I decided to take two &mdash; because as we all know: "When an elephant's trunk is up it means good luck(?). And this one's trunk was up(?)." Also scored a little mantlepiece plate, and a Kung Fu dude picking his ear. These are all such precious, adorable souvenirs, that there can be only one possible home for them: "these are going <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_(film)">straight to the pool room</a>."</p>
