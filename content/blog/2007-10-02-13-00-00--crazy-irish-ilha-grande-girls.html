<p>After dinner at the <a href="/blog/grande-aquario-barbeque">Aquario barbeque</a> tonight &mdash; when we followed dinner with more than a few drinks &mdash; we were joined by a pair of absolutely plastered, absolutely insane Irish chicks. Can't remember their names (perhaps they couldn't, either!), but they were one of the funniest pair of people I've met on this whole trip: they were cracking us up for hours on end! Between extensive slurps of beer, these girls were recounting to us the joys of Ireland, the benefits of not giving a f$#% about anything much, and their love of the chicken dance. Insert raised eyebrow here.</p>
