<p>Along with <a href="/blog/einat">Einat</a>, and some <em>Argentino</em> hippie friends of hers, I hung out on the beach all night tonight in Máncora, lying by a bonfire. There was a big bonfire going on at the busy end of the beach &mdash; just outside <a href="/blog/sol-y-mar-mancora">Sol y Mar</a> &mdash; but we made our own, a lot further up, away from the big crowds. Was a bit cold, but the fire kept us warm enough (the rum helped as well :P). I fell asleep when the hippies started singing entire albums of Argentinean songs. Not a bad night, really, if a bit weird.</p>
