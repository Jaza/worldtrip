<p>Loki is a massive hostel, accommodating well over 100 people, at the top of a big hill overlooking central Cusco. <em>Everyone</em> stays at Loki, which is good and bad, and which makes it something of an institution.

<p>Loki is a massive hostel, accommodating well over 100 people, at the top of a big hill overlooking central Cusco. <em>Everyone</em> stays at Loki, which is good and bad, and which makes it something of an institution. It's great value, it's real friendly, and it requires at least a week just to explore the place.</p>
<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> warm and clean, not too crowded, and copious.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> like I said, they have <em>everyone</em> here. Mostly a great crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> helpful, English-speaking, and most double as full-time guests.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> 5 minute walk from central square, up a big hill.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> good basic breakfast, but the dinner / lunch / snack food is a ripoff &mdash; go out or cook instead.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> 3 free PCs.</p>
<p><strong>Hot water:</strong> when I was first there, they had <em>no</em> water! (Due to problems Cusco-wide). Generally, though, hot water is plentiful and reliable.</p>
