<p>Seems like I'm losing my knack for finding good hostels, because this place was dull as batpoo. Very nice building and all, but hardly any kind of common hangout area, and almost nobody else around to meet and do stuff with. The best word to describe this place would be: sterile. Sorry, <em>Lonely Planet</em>, but you've let me down again. Maybe the ones further down the list for each city are the better ones. Anyway, next time I come to Oaxaca, I'm staying somewhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Rooms:</strong> nice, clean, spacious.</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong> boring, not very talkative.</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> nice, but dull.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> centre of things.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> very nice breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Internet:</strong> none (<em>very</em> surprising!).</p>
