<p>The last and the most spectacular thing that we saw today, on the Argentinean side of Iguazu Falls, was the <em>Garganta del Diablo</em> (lit: "Devil's Throat"), the biggest waterfall in the national park, and an absolutely, unbelievably, mind-blowingly massive stream of water. Do yourself a favour, and save this baby for the end of the day: it doesn't get much better than this. You could stand and stare at it for hours. We did. And the catwalk takes you right to the edge of it, where you have a simply phenomenal view of the thing cascading down all around and below you. Enjoy the photos below.</p>

<p>After ye 'ol <em>Garganta</em>, that was about it for the day, at Iguazu. We got the little choo-choo train back to the park entrance, where we were both hungry and in need of some serious time-killing (a very good combination). We addressed these pressing issues, by sitting down at one of the caf√©s in the park, and devouring a massive pepperoni pizza between the six of us. After that, it was back on our little tour bus, to shuttle us back to the <a href="/blog/hostel-inn-puerto-iguazu">Hostel Inn</a>, and we were done for the day. Very exhausting, but also quite dazzling!</p>
