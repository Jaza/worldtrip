_Our colourful tourguide; and John Harvard, founder of Harvard in 1638, in the background. Our guide explained that this is called "the statue of three lies", because: (1) it's not John Harvard (nobody knew what he looked like, when they made the statue); (2) John Harvard didn't found the university, he merely donated the land that it was built on; and (3) he didn't donate it in 1638, it was earlier. Apparently, this is also the third most-photographed statue in the USA, after the Statue of Liberty in New York, and Lincoln's statue at the memorial in Washington._
